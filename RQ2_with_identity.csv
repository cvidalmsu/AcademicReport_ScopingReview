We are motivated by the trend of modern CAD software towards cloud platforms and expanded collaborative features. Cloud-CAD platforms enable collaboration by increasing access, and reducing conflicts and barriers to file-sharing. In order to generate insight to support CAD collaboration, we analyze the real-world data from an industry partner's product development project, consisting of eight professional designers working on a cloud-CAD platform. This data corresponds to more than 1,420,000 actions over a span of eight months. Via hierarchical clustering, we group 79 unique CAD activities into 14 categories of CAD action groups, such as Part Studio, Assembly, Comment, View/Scan and Export. Next, we identify the degree to which each of the eight designers performs activity in these CAD action groups. We demonstrate the usefulness of this framework by highlighting insights revealed by the CAD action group mapping, confirmed via discussion with the industry partner. This CAD-type behaviour framework provides a tool for assessment and reflection on the types of behavioural tendencies present or missing on a team of designers. It can assist CAD educators and trainees in understanding their comprehensive CAD learning trajectory. Future extensions of the framework could leverage artificial intelligence techniques to provide real-time feedback on designer roles. © 2021 by ASME",Analytics; CAD; Clustering; Computer-aided design; Personality types,Analytic; Cloud platforms; Clusterings; Computer-aided design; Computer-aided design software; Design behaviours; Design platform; File Sharing; Personality types; Professional users; Computer aided design,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85119964205

A difficult challenge is generating game design ideas for a given behaviour change brief. This paper describes a card design tool that supports ideas generation. Each card summarises a behaviour change technique (BCT), provides an application example prompt, and identifies possible game design elements. The research question is: does the card design tool have perceived value for designers for generating ideas for behaviour change games? To evaluate the tool, four recently graduated game design students were given a set of 34 cards, instructions on using the cards, a game brief and then asked to generate ideas. The instructions included sorting the cards into piles with different headings (BCT, application example prompt, game design element). Cards were drawn randomly one at a time from each pile iteratively until all piles were exhausted. Participants recorded ideas using techniques they felt comfortable with e.g. note-taking, mind maps. Qualitative data on the students' perceived value of the design tool was collected using semi-structured interviews and analysed using reflexive thematic analysis. It showed that the cards had some value for ideas generation but often had too much information thereby stifling creativity. Some instructions were also confusing. The cards were modified: information made more succinct and a visual guide added to provide clearer instruction. The experiment was repeated with four serious games academics with more game design experience. Similar qualitative data was collected and analysed. This showed that the design tool provided a framework for designers to organise their initial ideas about how different elements of the game design brief might be tackled. It also helped to identify knowledge gaps and ideas that needed to be developed further. However, there remain some concerns about the tool's complexity inhibiting aspects of creative flow. © The Authors, 2021.

The timeconsuming step thereby is no longer the production, but the design of the parts. The key to solve this issue is the development of algorithms for automated process-specific design. Currently, the design process for parts fabricated by AM is still characterized by the procedure used for traditional fabrication processes. Several manual steps are necessary, requiring time and expert knowledge. At our institute, a MATLAB integrated design toolbox is developed, trying to overcome these issues. The basic idea is an algorithmic approach to design problems and a direct generation of surface models that can be fabricated in an AM process. It can be used to realize design tools that allow to define parts by their functionality and not by their geometry. In this work, the toolbox is used to create automated design algorithms for individual compliant mechanisms. A novel droplet-based AM process enabling hard/soft multi material printing is used to fabricate the parts. The scope of the software provides a component library of flexure hinges, mechanical connectors, and grippers that are generated from functional descriptions given by the design engineer. Several application examples of compliant mechanisms realized with the software are shown. An experiment is presented showing investigations of how well functional specifications can be reached.

Many implementations of communication protocols, including those in vehicular networks, occur within regulated environments where agile development methods are traditionally discouraged. We propose a framework and metrics to measure adherence to security, quality and software effectiveness regulations if developers desire the cost and schedule benefits of agile methods. After providing an overview of specific challenges that a regulated environment imposes on communications software development, we proceed to examine the 12 agile principles and how they relate to a regulatory environment. From this review we identify two metrics to measure performance of three key regulatory attributes of software for communications applications, and then recommend an approach of either tools, agile methods or DevOps that is best positioned to satisfy its regulated environment attributes. By considering the recommendations in this paper, managers of software-dominant communications programs in a regulated environment can gain insight into leveraging the benefits of agile methods. © 2020 IEEE.",Communication system security; Data privacy; Design tools and techniques; Iterative methods; Real-time and embedded systems,Application programs; Software quality; Agile development methods; Agile software development; Communications applications; Communications software; Privacy requirements; Regulatory environment; Security and privacy; Vehicular networks; Software design,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85083451767

To this end, Neural Concept exploits the power of deep learning to assist engineers to more quickly evaluate man-made designs and to guide them to more performing solutions. Our algorithms act as a force multiplier to humans’ creativity and help them come up more quickly with innovative designs that meet a variety of complex requirements. It uses the following approach: • Broadening the reach of simulation and optimization-driven design. Because of their historical origin, simulation tools are not well adapted to design optimization in production environments. It is extremely hard for design teams to leverage insights provided by advanced simulations and by the specialized teams who develop them. Neural Concept resolves this by integrating interactive simulation and design optimization tools in the workflow of the design engineers, instead of delegating this task to separate expert teams. Furthermore, the great engineering feats of our times, such as modern cars, airplanes, or nuclear submarines, have not been achieved by a few individuals with powerful ideas or algorithms. Instead, they are the result of a fragile network of interactions between hundreds of engineering teams, each with its own expertise. In that context, removing the friction introduced by simulations and lengthy back-and-forth technical exchanges dramatically improves the dynamics of large-scale engineering design. • Empowering creativity. Even in the hands of experts, past design tools do not deliver much in the way of radical innovation. They are typically used either to choose optimal configurations given a few predefined tuneable parameters or to make minor local adjustments to manually-built designs. This is a far cry from making major design decisions and guiding engineers towards bold new ideas, which is what we enable. The future requires making computer-driven exploration the central paradigm of engineering design processes, to broaden its scope of use. Neural Concept was created to promote and realize this vision, to empower every engineer, in every engineering organization to discover the very best. In this talk, we explain how Neural Concept’s Software, NCS, powered by recent algorithms based on Geometric Deep-Learning, allows shortcutting any simulation chain through a predictive model that outputs post processed results right from the CAD design. These models are being used in engineering companies to simplify processes and to emulate the expertise of simulation engineers in the hands of product or design engineers early in the development process. Thus, the number of iterations between teams are reduced while accelerating the design activities. © 2022 The authors.",,Computer aided design; Deep learning; Engineering education; Product design; Automotive suppliers; Automotive-OEM; Computational resources; Design engineers; Design optimization; Drive systems; Engineering organizations; Fast transition; Force multipliers; Power; Engineers,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85175795471

The telescope achieved resolving power superior to refractive and reflective optics and produced clear images of the surface of the Moon2.

The growing tendency towards using fractional-order proportional-integral-derivative (FOPID) control has been fueled mainly by the fact that these controllers have additional 'tuning knobs' that allow coherent adjustment of the dynamics of control systems. For instance, in certain cases, the capacity for additional frequency response shaping gives rise to the generation of control laws that lead to superior performance of control loops. These fractional-order control laws may allow fulfilling intricate control performance requirements that are otherwise not in the span of conventional integer-order control systems. However, there are underpinning points that are rarely addressed in the literature: (1) What are the particular advantages (in concrete figures) of FOPID controllers versus conventional, integer-order (IO) PID controllers in light of the complexities arising in the implementation of the former? (2) For real-time implementation of FOPID controllers, approximations are used that are indeed equivalent to high-order linear controllers. What, then, is the benefit of using FOPID controllers? Finally, (3) What advantages are to be had from having a near-ideal fractional-order behavior in control practice? In the present paper, we attempt to address these issues by reviewing a large portion of relevant publications in the fast-growing FO control literature, outline the milestones and drawbacks, and present future perspectives for industrialization of fractional-order control. Furthermore, we comment on FOPID controller tuning methods from the perspective of seeking globally optimal tuning parameter sets and how this approach can benefit designers of industrial FOPID control. We also review some CACSD (computer-aided control system design) software toolboxes used for the design and implementation of FOPID controllers. Finally, we draw conclusions and formulate suggestions for future research. © 2013 IEEE.",Fractional calculus; fractional control implementation; fractional-order PID control; frequency-domain analysis; industrial applications; optimal tuning,Computer control systems; Control theory; Frequency response; Linear control systems; Proportional control systems; Real time control; Three term control systems; Two term control systems; Computer aided control system design; Control performance; Design and implementations; Fractional order control; Future perspectives; Linear controllers; Proportional integral derivatives; Real-time implementations; Controllers,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85100508854

Generative design, with an algorithm that provides multiple options, could be a potential solution. The challenge is creating an intuitive, user-friendly application that optimizes engineers’ time, reducing manual iterations and lead to a good user experience (UX). A method for evaluating the UX is heuristic evaluation, in which heuristics are used to inspect a software product. Objective: Since generative design applications have specific features, generic heuristics may not detect all problems related to UX. This article presents a novel set of 9 heuristics to evaluate UX in generative design applications: UXH-GEDAPP. This set is focused on evaluating both UX attributes and specific features of generative design applications. Method: A formal methodology was used to develop the heuristics, through 7 stages: exploratory, descriptive, correlational, selection, specification, validation, and refinement. We performed 3 iterations and validated UXH-GEDAPP in 2 iterations through: heuristic evaluation, expert judgment, and user test. Since the methodology can be applied iteratively, we validated and refined the set to improve the proposal. Results: The results obtained in the validation stage indicate that UXH-GEDAPP is useful and more effective than generic heuristics when evaluating generative design applications. UXH-GEDAPP allows to detect specific usability/UX problems as well as more severe problems related to generative design applications. Furthermore, evaluators made fewer errors associating the detected problems with the proposed heuristics, compared to generic sets. Conclusion: UXH-GEDAPP is a new set of heuristics that encourages the creation and use of generative design applications with good UX. It can detect usability/UX problems and help correct them, as well as guide the development of new generative design applications for a pleasant and intuitive user experience. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",Generative design; Heuristic evaluation; Use experience; User experience heuristics,Design; Formal methods; Heuristic methods; Building design; Design applications; Design Methodology; Generative design; Heuristic evaluation; Infrastructure design; Traditional buildings; Use experience; User experience heuristic; Users' experiences; Iterative methods,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85183457449

Objective: The aim of our research is to support distributed software design activities in Virtual Reality (VR). Method: Using design science research methodology, we design and evaluate a tool for collaborative design in VR. We evaluate the collaboration efficiency and recall of design information when using the VR software design environment compared to a non-VR software design environment. Moreover, we collect the perceptions and preferences of users to explore the opportunities and challenges that were incurred by using the VR software design environment.

Objective: This paper aims to learn the challenges developers face while using the currently available DevOps tools and techniques along with the organizational challenges in DevOps practices. Method: We conduct an empirical study by applying topic modeling on 174K SO posts that contain DevOps discussions. We then validate and extend the empirical study findings with a survey of 21 professional DevOps practitioners. Results: We find that: (1) There are 23 DevOps topics grouped into four categories: Cloud & CI/CD Tools, Infrastructure as Code, Container & Orchestration, and Quality Assurance.

(3) The file management is the most popular topic followed by Jenkins Pipeline, while infrastructural Exception Handling and Jenkins Distributed Architecture are the most difficult topics (with least accepted answers). (4) In the survey, developers mention that it requires hands-on experience before current DevOps tools can be considered easy. They raised the needs for better documentation and learning resources to learn the rapidly changing DevOps tools and techniques.

The following characteristics distinguish Silvera from similar tools: (i) lightweight and editor-agnostic language, (ii) built with heterogeneity in mind, (iii) uses microservice-tailored metrics to evaluate the architecture of the designed system, and (iv) automatically generates the documentation. Silvera’s retargetable compiler transforms models into runnable code and produces the documentation for each microservice in the model. The compiler can produce code for any programming language or framework since code generators are registered as plugins. We present a case study that illustrates the use of Silvera and also discuss some current limitations and development directions. To evaluate Silvera, we conducted a survey based on A Framework for Qualitative Assessment of DSLs (FQAD), where we focused on the following DSL characteristics: functional suitability, usability, reliability, productivity, extendability, and expressiveness. Overall, the survey results show that Silvera satisfies these characteristics. © 2022 by the authors.

Immersive environments (IEs) can create a dynamic, multi-sensory, first-person view in computer-generated environments, and can improve designers' visual perception and awareness during performative design processes. This research addresses the need for interactive and integrated design tools for IEs toward better-performing architectural solutions in terms of daylighting illumination. In this context, building information modeling and performance simulations are identified as critical technologies to be integrated into performative architectural design. Design/methodology/approach: This research adopts a design science research (DSR) methodology involving an iterative process of development, validation and improvement of a novel and immersive tool, HoloArch, that supports design development during daylighting-informed design processes. HoloArch was implemented in a game engine during a spiral software development process. HoloArch allows users to interact with, visualize, modify and explore architectural models. The evaluation is performed in two workshops and a user study. A hybrid approach that combines qualitative and quantitative data collection was adopted for evaluation. Qualitative data analyses involve interviews, while quantitative data analyses involve both daylighting simulations and questionnaires (e.g. technology acceptance model (TAM), presence and system usability scale (SUS)). Findings: According to the questionnaire results, HoloArch had 92/100 for SUS, a mean value of 120.4 for presence questionnaire (PQ) and 9.4/10 for TAM. According to the simulation results, all participants improved the given building's daylighting performance using HoloArch. The interviews also indicated that HoloArch is an effective design tool in terms of augmented perception, continuous design processes, performative daylighting design and model interaction. However, challenges still remain regarding the complete integration of tools and simultaneous simulation visualization. The study concludes that IEs hold promising potentials where performative design actions at conceptual, spatial and architectural domains can take place interactively and simultaneously with immediate feedback. Originality/value: The research integrates building information modeling (BIM), performative daylighting simulations and IEs in an interactive environment for the identification of potentials and limitations in performative architectural design. Different from existing immersive tools for architecture, HoloArch offers a continuous bidirectional workflow between BIM tools and IEs. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Architecture; Building information modeling; Design; Innovation; Integration; Simulation,Daylighting; Information theory; Iterative methods; Sensory perception; Software design; Surveys; Building Information Model - BIM; Design science researches (DSR); Design/methodology/approach; Interactive Environments; Qualitative data analysis; Software development process; System Usability Scale (SUS); Technology acceptance model; Architectural design,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85096713073

The primary objective of this study is to provide engineers and researchers with a robust and streamlined approach for the early stages of electric vehicle (EV) design, offering valuable insights into the performance, energy consumption, current flow, and thermal behavior of these advanced automotive systems. Recognizing the complex nature of contemporary EVs, the study highlights the need for efficient design tools that facilitate decision-making during the conceptual phases of development. The PerfECT Design Tool is presented as a multi-level framework, divided into four logically sequential modules: Performance, Energy, Currents, and Temperature. These modules are underpinned by sound theoretical foundations and are implemented using a combination of MATLAB/Simulink and the vehicle dynamics software VI-CRT. The research culminates in the validation of the model through a series of experimental maneuvers conducted with a Tesla Model 3, establishing its accuracy in representing the mechanical, electrical, and thermal behavior of BEVs. The study’s main findings underscore the viability of the design tool as an asset in the initial phases of BEV design. Beyond its primary application, the tool holds promise for broader utilization, including the development of active control systems, advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), and solutions for autonomous driving within the domain of electric vehicles. © 2023 by the author.",batteries; design methodology; electric powertrain; electric vehicles; modelling and simulation; vehicle dynamics,Advanced driver assistance systems; Automobile drivers; Decision making; MATLAB; Secondary batteries; Vehicle performance; Battery; Battery-electric vehicles; Design Methodology; Design tool; Electric power trains; Model and simulation; Thermal behaviours; Vehicle design; Vehicle modelling; Vehicle's dynamics; Energy utilization,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85180700819

The course is taught in the Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) Department at the University of Texas at Arlington and is offered as CSE 4356 System on Chip Design for computer engineering undergraduates, as CSE 5356 for computer engineering graduate students, and as EE 5315 for electrical engineering graduate students. It is taught as one course combining all numbers. All students are given the same lectures, course materials, assignments, and projects. Grading standards and expectations are the same for all students as well. The course in its current form was first offered in fall 2020 and was taught online due to COVID-19 restrictions. The course was offered again in fall 2021 in a traditional on-campus, in-person mode of delivery. Two seasoned educators, with more than eighty years of total teaching experience, combined to team teach the course. One also brought more than thirty years of industrial design experience to the course. SoC FPGA devices have been available for use by designers for more than 10 years and are widely used in applications that require both an embedded microcomputer and FPGA-based logic for real-time computationally-intense solutions. Such solutions require skills in C programming, HDL programming, bus topologies forming the bridge between FPGA fabric and the microprocessor space, Linux operating systems and virtualization, and kernel device driver development. The breadth of the skills that were conveyed to students necessitated a team teaching approach to leverage the diverse background of the instructors. With such a wide range of topics, one of the biggest challenges was developing a course that was approachable for a greatly varied population of students - a mix of Computer Engineering (CpE) and Electrical Engineering (EE) students at both the graduate and undergraduate level. Another, perhaps less obvious, challenge was the inherently application focus of the course, which presents challenges to many graduate students whose undergraduate degree lacked a robust hands-on design experience. Selection of an appropriate project was key to making the course effective and providing a fun learning experience for students. The projects were aligned to relevant industry applications, stressing complex modern intellectual property (IP) work flows, while still being approachable to students. The design of a universal asynchronous receiver transmitter (UART) IP module in 2020 and a serial peripheral interface (SPI) IP module in 2021 were chosen as the projects for the first two offerings of the course. The Terasic/Intel DE1-SoC development board and Intel Quartus Prime 18.1 design software were the technologies chosen for the course. The development board and basic test instruments were provided to each student in a take-home lab kit. The system on chip design course has proven to be a popular but challenging course for our undergraduate and graduate students in computer engineering and electrical engineering. The course has demonstrated that it is possible to successfully teach an advanced design-oriented course to students of varying majors, levels, educational backgrounds, and cultures. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2022.",,Application specific integrated circuits; C (programming language); Computer hardware description languages; Computer operating systems; Curricula; Engineering education; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); Grading; Intellectual property; Intellectual property core; Programmable logic controllers; System-on-chip; Teaching; Computer engineering; Computer science and engineerings; Design course; Design experience; Engineering graduate students; Graduate students; Oriented systems; Project oriented; System on chips design; Systems-on-Chip; Students,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85138306929

The purpose of this paper is to review the ways in which design methods and techniques used in other fields may be used in support of the space mission concept development process and space technology development. Designers are almost synonymous with the consumer product, automotive and entertainment industries. Fields such as Product Design, Transportation Design and Entertainment emphasize finding solutions to problems using exploratory design methods and techniques. Often, they are leaders in their organizations. However, there is not a direct appreciation or understanding of how to utilize these methods and techniques within aerospace. These methods have been shown to support mission concept development, however may also directly support technology development, as is seen in the consumer product industry. Evidence shows that these methods have sporadically been utilized by NASA for habitat design, software development and astronaut wearables. This paper explores opportunities within the space mission concept development process where these techniques are currently used and develops a design library of methods and techniques used outside of Aerospace that may be supportive of technology development. The current Pre-Phase A concept development process is mapped along with exploratory design methods used in other industries. Design Thinking is a heuristic problem solving method that can be applied to many fields. Human Centered Design and User Centered Design have been utilized for architecture and software development; these same tools could also be used to help inform the design of long term human habitation system on planetary surfaces. The Imagineering process is instrumental in theme park development; this paper argues it should also inform design of robotic science missions such as Mars Sciences. Science Fiction Thinking is a method of extrapolating future technology. How can this type of thinking inform the design of systems that aim to detect life in locations such as the liquid oceans on Europa and Titan? Techniques that are instrumental throughout these methods, such as storyboarding, sketching and prototyping are also defined. Interviews with employees within aerospace, consumer products and entertainment may shed light on opportunities and barriers to utilizing these techniques.

In particular, we see that most of the cloud-based applications and services often consist of hundreds of micro-services; however, the traditional monolithic pattern is no longer suitable for today’s development life-cycle. This is due to the difficulties of maintenance, scale, load balance, and many other factors associated with it. Consequently, people switch their focus on containerization—a lightweight virtualization technology. The saving grace is that it can use machine resources more efficiently than the virtual machine (VM). In VM, a guest OS is required to simulate on the host machine, whereas containerization enables applications to share a common OS. Furthermore, containerization facilitates users to create, delete, or deploy containers effortlessly. In order to manipulate and manage the multiple containers, the leading Cloud providers introduced the container orchestration platforms, such as Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, Nomad, and many others. In this paper, a rigorous study on Kubernetes from an administrator’s perspective is conducted. In a later stage, serverless computing paradigm was redefined and integrated with Kubernetes to accelerate the development of software applications. Theoretical knowledge and experimental evaluation show that this novel approach can be accommodated by the developers to design software architecture and development more efficiently and effectively by minimizing the cost charged by public cloud providers (such as AWS, GCP, Azure). However, serverless functions are attached with several issues, such as security threats, cold start problem, inadequacy of function debugging, and many other. Consequently, the challenge is to find ways to address these issues. However, there are difficulties and hardships in addressing all the issues altogether. Respectively, in this paper, we simply narrow down our analysis toward the security aspects of serverless. In particular, we quantitatively measure the success probability of attack in serverless (using Attack Tree and Attack–Defense Tree) with the possible attack scenarios and the related countermeasures. Thereafter, we show how the quantification can reflect toward the end-to-end security enhancement. In fine, this study concludes with research challenges such as the burdensome and error-prone steps of setting the platform, and investigating the existing security vulnerabilities of serverless computing, and possible future directions. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Attack tree; Container; Container orchestration; FaaS; Kubernetes; Security; Serverless computing,Application programs; Costs; Forestry; Life cycle; Network security; Software design; Virtual machine; Attack tree; Cloud providers; Container orchestration; Empirical research; Empirical studies; Faas; Kubernetes; Research challenges; Security; Serverless computing; Containers,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85123475646

The fast growth in the urban population is a serious concern for city administration. It leads to various challenges while handling problems of resource crunch and managing them. Developments that relate to smart cities are helping the administration address these problems. Its initial effort prediction and its scalability are the main features for the completion of a successful smart-city project. The initiative depends on many factors that are inter-related. It is not possible to change or optimise certain kinds of aspects separately. The last-minute change in the schedule raises the project budget and time. In the early phases of the project, a realistic and concrete project plan needs a fair estimate of effort. This projected effort helps to monitor and handle the activities of application creation by the developer. Unfair allocation of efforts and resources between development activities, including software projects, contributes to the failure of smart city projects, too. Therefore, for smart city ventures, the secret to success is an accurate estimation of implementation activities at the earliest. Numerous approaches are available for effort prediction of software as well as hardware projects used to develop the smart city projects. Hence, the gap in the different methods available creates thrust areas for researchers to investigate and propose an effort prediction model for smart city-based projects. In this paper, a model has been formulated that takes into consideration a set of critical factors for a given IoT based application used to develop smart city in the subject, and it further provides estimation for the effort. © 2021 Institute of Physics Publishing.

Therefore, a good user experience is fundamental for their success in the market. Companies employ highly specialized people in front-end development and User Experience (UX) User Interface (UI) design to achieve this goal. Their collaboration is critical and raises some efficiency challenges, particularly in Low-Code platforms, such as OutSystems. UX/UI designers typically use specialized tools with their underlying metamodels. OutSystems developers use an integrated development environment with the underlying OutSystems metamodel. While there are some code-generation plugins for popular design tools, these do not generate code for Low-Code platforms. The current transformation process from design to development is done 100% manually, resulting in a loss of efficiency. Our goal is to accelerate this transformation process from a design model to a development model to mitigate this inefficiency. To do so, we developed an approach using model transformations to automate part of the process. Namely, it automates the generation of application pages/screens by composing the screen mockups in a design technology (such as Figma or Sketch) with a library of reusable UI components to instantiate the design in a front-end technology (such as OutSystems). Our approach was validated by a professional team of frontend developers from an established enterprise-grade Low-Code platform who applied and evaluated this work on some of their past real projects. Preliminary results show an overall acceptance of the developed tool with a possible increase of 150% to 400% in the number of pages/screens that they can deliver with the same effort. This approach allows mitigating a bottleneck faced by the development team. To increase the value they could offer to customers (e.g., by producing more application screens in the same time frame), they would need to recruit new collaborators whose skill set is high on demand. Our work offers a more economical alternative to increase their productivity. © 2021 IEEE.",Automation; Design To Code; Front-end Development; Generation; Low-Code Platforms; OutSystems,Automation; Codes (symbols); Computer software reusability; Design; Efficiency; Design to code; Front end; Front-end development; Generation; Interface designers; Low-code platform; Meta model; Outsystem; Transformation process; Users' experiences; User interfaces,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85124004703

The popularity of DHM usage in product development is increasing, and many companies take advantage of DHM in their virtual prototyping studies. However, DHM is usually interpreted as a post-conceptualization check gate methodology and is often applied to correct ergonomics assumptions. Although this approach provides some insight into product performance, designers often miss more widespread opportunities in terms of utilizing DHM as an early design stage design tool. This research presents our ongoing efforts in developing DHM-based early design computational Human Factors Engineering (HFE) support tools. We engage this reflection by summarizing two early design frameworks emerging from our recent work: (1) Prototyping Toolbox and (2) Human Error and Functional Failure Reasoning (HEFFR). These frameworks are originated from the Digital Human-in-the-loop (DHIL) methodology. DHIL proposes a simulation-based computational design methodology that builds a bridge between existing Computer-Aided Engineering (CAE) software packages and computational HFE tools to address safety, comfort, and performance-related issues early in design. Our primary focus in this paper is to demonstrate the frameworks emerging from our recent D-HIL research to promote better early design decision-making for human-centered product design. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Digital Human Modeling; Engineering design; Ergonomics; Fault modeling; Human Factors Engineering; Human-centered design,Bridges; Computer aided engineering; Computer aided software engineering; Computer software; Decision making; Ergonomics; Health risks; Risk management; Safety engineering; Computational design; Computational strategy; Design capacity; Digital human modeling; Early design decisions; Early design stages; Functional failure; Product performance; Product design,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85112226526

This task could benefit from the high performance tools offered by state of the art Open source Computer Aided Design (CAD). Although these applications have reached a good level of maturity, their use in the artistic field is still not so widespread, due to an initial barrier probably caused by a lack of accessible documentation and best practices. This article aims to analyse and experiment a variety of open source Computer Aided Design (CAD) applications with the goal of further spread the use of open source CAD software among media artists, designers,and researchers in the field of STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, Mathematics) applications[17]. Following a research through design approach, we will provide up date guidelines regarding how to design every aspect of an electronic music interface using exclusively open source software. To represent the various topics of our research we defined a hypothetical electronic device, and the workflow will be illustrated by describing and analysing all the steps that is necessary to cover in order to to bring such object from a breadboard overloaded with wires and components to a more stable and reliable prototype.

During the Fontan procedure, a vascular graft is sutured between the inferior vena cava and pulmonary artery to divert deoxygenated blood flow to the lungs via passive flow. Customizing the graft configuration can maximize the long-term benefits. However, planning patient-specific procedures has several challenges, including the ability for physicians to customize grafts and evaluate their hemodynamic performance. Objective: The aim of this study was to develop a virtual reality (VR) Fontan graft modeling and evaluation software for physicians. A user study was performed to achieve 2 additional goals: (1) to evaluate the software when used by medical doctors and engineers, and (2) to explore the impact of viewing hemodynamic simulation results in numerical and graphical formats. Methods: A total of 5 medical professionals including 4 physicians (1 fourth-year resident, 1 third-year cardiac fellow, 1 pediatric intensivist, and 1 pediatric cardiac surgeon) and 1 biomedical engineer voluntarily participated in the study. The study was pre-scripted to minimize the variability of the interactions between the experimenter and the participants. All participants were trained to use the VR gear and our software, CorFix. Each participant designed 1 bifurcated and 1 tube-shaped Fontan graft for a single patient. A hemodynamic performance evaluation was then completed, allowing the participants to further modify their tube-shaped design. The design time and hemodynamic performance for each graft design were recorded. At the end of the study, all participants were provided surveys to evaluate the usability and learnability of the software and rate the intensity of VR sickness. Results: The average times for creating 1 bifurcated and 1 tube-shaped graft after a single 10-minute training session were 13.40 and 5.49 minutes, respectively, with 3 out 5 bifurcated and 1 out of 5 tube-shaped graft designs being in the benchmark range of hepatic flow distribution. Reviewing hemodynamic performance results and modifying the tube-shaped design took an average time of 2.92 minutes. Participants who modified their tube-shaped graft designs were able to improve the nonphysiologic wall shear stress (WSS) percentage by 7.02%. All tube-shaped graft designs improved the WSS percentage compared to the native surgical case of the patient. None of the designs met the benchmark indexed power loss. Conclusions: VR graft design software can quickly be taught to physicians with no engineering background or VR experience. Improving the CorFix system could improve performance of the users in customizing and optimizing grafts for patients. With graphical visualization, physicians were able to improve WSS percentage of a tube-shaped graft, lowering the chance of thrombosis. Bifurcated graft designs showed potential strength in better flow split to the lungs, reducing the risk for pulmonary arteriovenous malformations. ©Byeol Kim, Phong Nguyen, Yue-Hin Loke, Vincent Cleveland, Xiaolong Liu, Paige Mass, Narutoshi Hibino, Laura Olivieri, Axel Krieger.",congenital heart disease; heart; surgery; surgical planning; usability study; virtual reality,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85133154425

This outreach consortium is financed by the Department of Energy DOE, as well as the NNSA (National Nuclear Security Administration). With this summer program, our objective is to serve advanced manufacturing, as evolving technology and to improve STEM education and prepare future engineers for the new challenges related to this new technology. The main objective is to teach the students the use of professional design tools made for today's designers and engineers, such as Autodesk Inventor, as well as the use of 3D printers. In addition, science, and math are integrated to show relationships and solve challenges related to several projects. The progressive level of the projects related to producing better parts, assemblies, and drawings mostly focuses on critical thinking and the development of creative solutions (problem-solving, writing, visual art, communication skills, and open-mindedness) to problems. The purpose of this paper is to introduce the consortium management and the use of the summer program as example to describe the methodology implemented, based on active learning, perform experimentation, and the use of software, such as Autodesk Inventor. In particular, we will discuss several activities performed during this summer camp. A collaborative work between an NCAT faculty and high school instructors have been developed over the years served for the success of this program. The high-school instructors, as well as the counselors, helped with the process, as well as with the learning process. Their participation was very useful in terms of addressing the appropriate pedagogy, communicating with high-school students, and keeping them focused and task. We discuss the project design program from students' point of view, and the experience earned in design, integration, and also in written and oral communication skills.

Deployed sensors may not perform as intended due to the heterogeneity of USSN devices’ hardware and software when combined with the Internet. Hence, USSNs are regarded as complex distributed systems. As such, USSN designers will encounter challenges throughout the design phase related to time, complexity, sharing diverse domain experiences (viewpoints), and ensuring optimal performance for the deployed USSNs. Accordingly, during the USSN development and deployment phases, a few Underwater Environmental Constraints (UECs) should be taken into account. These constraints may include the salinity level and the operational depth of every physical component (sensor, server, etc.) that will be utilized throughout the duration of the USSN information systems’ development and implementation. To this end, in this article we present how we integrated an Artificial Intelligence (AI) Database, an extended ArchiMO meta-model, and a design tool into our previously proposed Enterprise Architecture Framework. This addition proposes adding new Underwater Environmental Constraints (UECs) to the AI Database, which is accessed by USSN designers when they define models, with the goal of simplifying the USSN design activity. This serves as the basis for generating a new version of our ArchiMO design tool that includes the UECs. To illustrate our proposal, we use the newly generated ArchiMO to create a model in the MO domain. Furthermore, we use our self-developed domain-specific model compiler to produce the relevant simulation code. Throughout the design phase, our approach contributes to the handling and controling of the uncertainties and variances of the provided quality of service that may occur during the performance of the USSNs, as well as reducing the design activity’s complexity and time. It provides a way to share the different viewpoints of the designers in the domain of USSNs. © 2024 by the authors.",ArchiMate; Domain-Specific Modeling Languages; Enterprise Architecture; IIoUT; IMS; Marine Observatories; NS-3; Smart Fusion Servers; Smart Sensors,Modeling languages; Network architecture; Observatories; Smart sensors; montirelin; Archimate; Domain specific modeling languages; Domain-Specific Modelling Languages; Enterprise Architecture; IIoUT; IMS; Marine observatories; NS-3; Smart fusion server; Smart sensor networks; article; artificial intelligence; deep sea; drug development; duration; human; Internet; salinity; sensor; simulation; software; Sensor networks,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85191389179

However, widespread adoption is impeded by the lack of user-friendly design tools due to the necessity of domain-specific expertise in computer-aided design (CAD) software and the overwhelming level of design freedom afforded by the MEX process. To overcome these barriers and facilitate the democratisation of design (DoD), this article introduces an innovative, generative-based design (GBD) methodology aimed at enabling non-technical users to create functional components independently. The novelty of this methodology lies in its capacity to simplify complex design tasks, making them more accessible to non-designers. The proposed methodology was tested in the design of a load-bearing part, yielding a functional component within two design iterations. A comparative analysis with the conventional CAD-based process revealed that the GBD methodology enables the DoD, reflected in a 68% reduction in design activities and a decrease in design difficulty of 62% in requisite know-how and a 55% in understanding. Through the creation and implementation of this methodology, the article demonstrates a pioneering integration of state-of-the-art techniques of generative design with design repositories enabling effective co-design with non-designers.  © The Author(s), 2023.

The technology transfer has taken place into engineering design practice for two decades now through the introduction of design guidelines. However, the lack of design software in the market as well as the limited academic education of present engineers has been an obstacle against the wide spread of this technology as a preferred alternative for repair and strengthening. Recently, a US-based group has responded to this need by developing professional interactive software to analyze and design structural elements strengthened with FRP. One of the very first products that came out of this effort was the development of a detailed analysis and design tool on strengthening of RC beams. This software complies with the provisions of ACI 440.2R-17 and is available interchangeably in SI and US customary unit systems. It is capable of analyzing rectangular, T and inverted L sections strengthened with externally bonded FRP or NSM bars. It allows for one compression layer and three tension layers of steel and provides strength and serviceability calculations. It has a graphics tool for to-scale drawing of sections, and it offers a detailed professional design report. The premium version is equipped with a graphics based optimized design feature that eliminates the need to perform design iterations. Its user-friendly interface is an asset to any design office. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Design tools; Flexural strengthening; FRP sheets; NSM bars; RC beams,Concrete beams and girders; Engineering education; Product design; Reinforced concrete; Software design; Strengthening (metal); Design softwares; Design tool; Externally bonded; Flexural strengthening; FRP sheet; Near surface mounted; Near surface mounted bar; Optimized designs; R.C beams; RC beams; Technology transfer,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85121920712
