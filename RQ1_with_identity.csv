The digitisation of MEDs has become increasingly important due to demands for data authenticity, intellectual property protection, efficient data storage and communication, and compliance with data integrity and security regulations. Unlike CAD-based engineering design software, legacy MEDs are often manually drawn or contain manually labeled specifications on blueprints. A notable gap exists in the automated process pipeline of modern Computer-Aided Tolerance (CAT) software, particularly in integrating Geometrical Tolerance Specification Callouts (GTSC) on MEDs. This study proposes an integrated model based on digital image processing and deep learning, which combines character (symbol, text and number) localization, segmentation, and recognition to intelligently identify and read GTSCs on MEDs. The focus of this work is on image filtering, GTSC block localization and tilt correction, multiple lines and character segmentation, and semantic recognition. Experiment results demonstrate that this innovative technique effectively automates the labor-intensive process of reading and registering GTSC with a precision performance that meets industry benchmarks. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",Character extraction; Character recognition; Deep learning; Digitalization; Geometrical tolerance specification callouts; GTSC blocks; Mechanical engineering drawings,Automation; Benchmarking; Computer aided design; Deep learning; Digital storage; E-learning; Life cycle; Product design; Semantic Segmentation; Semantics; Specifications; Callouts; Character extraction; Deep learning; Digitalization; Engineering drawing; Geometrical tolerance specification callout; Geometrical tolerance specification callout block; Geometrical tolerances; Mechanical engineering drawing; Tolerance specifications; Character recognition,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85186111848

The identification of nucleolar morphology and activity via novel biomarkers presents new avenues for the development of therapeutic approaches for a variety of human diseases, including cancer, neurodegeneration, and aging. Therefore, specific detection of the nucleolus with fluorescence probes is of critical importance for clinical applications. In the present study, a series of benzoxazole-N,N-dialkylphenylamines derivative compounds were designed and synthesized based on the benzothiazole-based fluorescence probe Thioflavin T (ThT). Among the compounds, BX-3 and BX-16, which carry electron-withdrawing substituents in the benzoxazole ring, were observed to have higher fluorescence emission at wavelengths of 470 and 465 nM, respectively. The general morphology and divisions of the cells were examined under inverted and light microscopes, respectively, and the fluorescence potentials of selected compounds were determined using immunofluorescence microscopy. The fluorescence intensity of molecules and 3D interactive surface plot images of cells were analyzed using ImageJ software. Cell imaging analyses showed that BX-6 and BX-13, like ThT, specifically stain the cell nucleolus. Moreover, molecular docking studies showed that the compounds could identify the RNA-rich nucleolus by binding with high affinity to the guanine region in the RNA structure. The results suggest that the compounds may be an initial route in developing specific biosensor compounds for nucleolus imaging. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",Benzoxazole; Biomarkers; Cell imaging; Molecular docking; Nucleolus; Thioflavin T,Cells; Cytology; Fluorescence; Molecular imaging; Molecular modeling; Morphology; Neurodegenerative diseases; Probes; RNA; Benzoxazole; Cell imaging; Cell-be; Cell/B.E; Cell/BE; Design applications; Fluorescence probes; Molecular docking; Nucleolus; Thioflavin T; Biomarkers,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85189525357

The intention of the study is to achieve positive properties in components and to shorten the development phase when applying DfAM methods, specifically the use of topological optimization (TO). In development of the design methodology using TO, the procedure and results were addressed and consulted with a specific manufacturer in the industry who provided the necessary materials for the research. The methodology was formed based on the partial results and their analysis for selecting the right solutions, such as the analysis of traditional procedures, strength checks, meshes, boundary conditions, etc. The procedure and design were focused and limited to additive manufacturing, specifically SLM. The results agreed with the research aim, and a significant reduction in times was achieved over traditional design methods. There was also a reduction in masses. The research concludes with an evaluation of the results together with those of the manufacturer, and a statement of the benefits, particularly for the scientific discipline and practice. It was concluded that, by implementing the given design methods, it is possible to significantly reduce the financial costs with proper application, simplify the operation of design software and create the possibility of use in training workplaces. With further research and extension of the applicability of the given methodology, substantial positive factors for development can be assumed. However, it should not be forgotten that the use of DfAM methods is greatly influenced by advances in additive manufacturing. © 2023 by the authors.",additive manufacturing; design for additive manufacturing; development of designing; topology optimization,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85192370195

The lack of standardized procedures for pediatric formulations further complicates the process. Manipulating adult formulations for children can lead to suboptimal efficacy and safety concerns. To overcome these challenges, minitablets or spinklets are preferred for the geriatric and pediatric population due to their smaller size and flexible dose adjustment. The aim of this study is the development of a 3D printed spinklets formulation of celecoxib, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, using hot melt extrusion to address the limitations of traditional manufacturing methods. Three different formulations of celecoxib were prepared using Poly-2-ethyl-tetra-oxazoline (Aquazol) with and without surfactant. Subsequently, the mechanical properties and solubility of the drug-loaded filaments were evaluated. Solid state characterization confirmed the drug conversion into an amorphous form during the extrusion process, Computer-aided design software facilitate sprinklets design for fused deposition modeling and scanning electron microscopy assess the surface morphology. Sophorolipids plasticize better than TPGS, resulting in lowering processing temperatures during melt extrusion. In vitro drug release showed successful enhancements in the dissolution of oral medications for pediatric patients, considering their distinctive physiological characteristics. Overall, this study demonstrates the successful development of PEtOx-based 3D printed celecoxib sprinklets by coupling hot-melt extrusion and 3D printing technology.

The processing of amber is complex and expensive because mass or serial production is not possible. Moreover, processing is challenging because each product is treated as unique and requires individual handling. The optimisation process is illustrated using the example of amber blocks that were scanned to obtain virtual 3D models. The scope of this work includes the characterisation of three-dimensional jewellery design processes, along with a description of a wide range of methods and functions used in computer-aided jewellery design. The use of computer-aided design software for developing virtual models of decorative products used in goldsmithing is described in this paper. The obtained sets of models underwent engineering analysis using Boolean algebra and data science calculations. In this way, a design methodology was developed regarding the selection of input material as the unprocessed stone for jewellery modelling. The developed method allows for the minimisation of material waste, which is associated with reducing costs in the processing of amber. This article also describes the differences between previous traditional methods and the authors’ proprietary method.

The functional structure of the flexible production cell, its configuration, programming methods and application in industry are explained in detail. The complete technology design was carried out using the ESPRIT software package, which involved selecting the processing system, introducing auxiliary accessories, selecting the required sequence of operations, defining the tool, defining the processing mode, creating the tool path, and generating the NC code for the CNC machine. With the help of a digital model of the machine (known as a digital twin), a controller emulator, machine parameters and a post processor, the system provides precise simulation and machine-optimized NC code. ESPRIT offers factory-developed post-processors for most types of machines and control units, which generate NC code without requiring subsequent modifications. It is also possible to create special post processors for special types of machines and applications. In this particular case, due to the work piece geometry and production speed, the 4 + 1 strategy was chosen on the 5-axis machine, involving the simultaneous movement of four axes and the indexical movement of one axis.

The production procedure is designed in the form of a parametric workflow (CAD model), which significantly speeds up the designing process of the prosthesis. This procedure is not fixedly dependent on the software (SW) equipment and is fully transferable into another SW environment. The use of these prostheses will significantly increase the comfort of their patients’ lives. It is possible to produce prostheses faster and in larger amounts and variants by the usage of additive technology. The input for the own production of the prosthesis is a model of the internal soft socket of the patient. This soft socket (soft bed) is made by a qualified prosthetist. A 3D-scanned CAD model is obtained afterward using the scanning method by an automatic laser projector. An editable, parametric external socket (modifiable in any CAD format) is generated from the obtained 3D scan using a special algorithmic model. This socket, after the necessary individual modifications, is transferred to 3D printing technology and produced using powder technology Multi Jet Fusion (HP MJF). The result of the designed and tested procedure is a quickly editable 3D-printed outer socket (main part of prosthesis), which is able to fully replace the current long-fiber composite solution. Production of current solutions is relatively time-consuming, and only one piece is produced in a given time. The newly designed technology eliminates this.

It bears the body weight and directly influences the biomechanics of the foot and the body. These insoles are used to minimize the stress by reducing plantar pressure between support points hence minimizing the pressure. Such customized insoles have usually been produced by either handmade or subtractive methods. Fused deposition modeling (FDM) has opened innovative ways for the manufacture of orthotic insoles. In recent studies, no specific computer-aided design (CAD) tools are available to design and manufacture the insole, which is the primary focus. This work aims to evaluate established CAD techniques for designing and fabricating insoles utilizing different manufacturing processes. The evaluation is based on a prior analysis of the possibilities for functionalizing insole materials and structures. In this study, multiple software tools are utilized for designing custom insoles, considering pressure points and a three-dimensional (3D) foot scan of an individual. The research highlights how the implementation of software enables a significant level of customization by integrating pressure mapping data into the insole design process. A novel CAD approach for designing an orthotic insole has been provided in this work. Soft poly-lactic acid (PLA) is used to fabricate an insole using FDM technology. The gyroid and solid samples were evaluated following ASTM standards. When compared to the solid construction, the gyroid structure has a high specific energy absorption capability, which is used to create the orthotic insole. The results of the experiment suggest that the selection of the structure for customized insole design is significantly affected by the infill density parameter. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",Computer-aided design; Energy absorption; Fused deposition modelling; Gyroid; Orthotic Insole,"Equipment Design; Foot; Foot Orthoses; Pressure; Printing, Three-Dimensional; Walking; ASTM standards; Deposition; Energy absorption; Fused Deposition Modeling; Lactic acid; Layered manufacturing; Orthopedics; Orthotics; polylactic acid; Body weight; Computer aided design tools; Computer-aided design; Design and Development; Design and manufactures; Gyroid structure; Gyroids; Orthotic insole; Plantar pressures; Subtractive method; Article; cell size; computer aided design; conceptual framework; controlled study; energy absorption; fused deposition modeling; human; manufacturing; plantar pressure; pore size; product design; relative density; surface property; thickness; three dimensional printing; equipment design; foot; pressure; three dimensional printing; walking; Computer aided design",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85164222292

The part model is designed in computer-aided design (CAD) software, the planning process is planned in computer-aided process planning (CAPP) software, and the machining process is simulated in computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) software. However, there are still digital gaps between design, process, and manufacturing, which affect the integration and efficiency of engineering information. Manufacturing features are considered digital carriers that can bridge the gap. The knowledge of design, process, and manufacturing can be integrated on manufacturing features to achieve the information flow across different engineering applications. However, the existing approaches cannot solve the feature recognition problem very well. The recognition criterion of these approaches do not have the generalization ability. And they also do not deal with the interacting features appropriately. To improve the performance of feature recognition of 3-axis milling parts, this paper proposed a hybrid feature recognition framework based on graph approach and rule approach. The hybrid framework solves the recognition problem of interacting features with the layered decomposition method. And the general wire criterion is proposed to improve the robustness. In addition, the general calculation method of adjacency attributes is also the original contribution. The final experimental results show that the proposed hybrid framework works well and can be applied to the actual engineering applications. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd",CAD model; Digital manufacturing; Feature recognition; Manufacturing information,Computer aided design; Computer aided process planning; Computer software; Decomposition methods; Milling (machining); Computer aided design models; Computing technology; Design-process; Digital manufacturing; Engineering applications; Features recognition; Hybrid framework; Manufacturing features; Manufacturing informations; Milling parts; Computer aided manufacturing,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85165086348

However, after decades of implementation in engineering schools, the Finite Element Method (FEM) still challenges instructors and course designers. To align learning outcomes with industrial requirements, this article analyzes the opinions of Mexican industrial and academic experts about four important aspects of FEM education. The results suggest that specialists agree on the importance of including a mixture of theoretical and applied topics in the syllabus but prefer practical skills over fundamental concepts. Besides learning from defeaturing to postprocessing a model, engineering students must know how to plan, verify, and validate their finite element studies. Experts expect early design engineers to be proficient with Computer-Aided Design (CAD) and have relevant mathematical and programming skills. Instead of using specialized software, students' first exposure to FEM may be based on FEA tools embedded in CAD systems. Also, academic and industrial respondents request the incorporation of modal, thermal and nonlinear analysis procedures in the course timetable. Finally, the statistical analysis shows that the two types of respondents share one common vision about the importance of the aspects under study.

HIGA enables engineers to design and analyze hydraulic structures in an integrated and interactive environment. In addition, HIGA implements the features of volume parameterization, contact detection, and Nitsche's method, so it is able to address 3D multi-block models with gaps and overlaps.

The protocol spans multiple steps of the medical device development pipeline, including initial concept design of the scaffold implant, digital twin in silico finite element modeling, manufacturing of the device prototype, in vivo device implantation, and in vitro laboratory mechanical testing. First, a patient-specific one-body scaffold implant used for reconstructing a critical-sized defect along the lower border of the sheep mandible ramus was designed using on computed-tomographic (CT) imagery and computer-aided design software. Next, the biomechanical performance of the implant was predicted numerically by simulating physiological load conditions in a digital twin in silico finite element model of the sheep mandible. This allowed for possible redesigning of the implant prior to commencing in vivo experimentation. Then, two types of polymeric biomaterials were used to manufacture the mandibular scaffold implants: poly ether ether ketone (PEEK) and poly ether ketone (PEK) printed with fused deposition modeling (FDM) and selective laser sintering (SLS), respectively. Then, after being implanted for 13 weeks in vivo, the implant and surrounding bone tissue was harvested and microCT scanned to visualize and quantify neo-tissue formation in the porous space of the scaffold. Finally, the implant and local bone tissue was assessed by in vitro laboratory mechanical testing to quantify the osteointegration. The protocol consists of six component procedures: (i) scaffold design and finite element analysis to predict its biomechanical response, (ii) scaffold fabrication with FDM and SLS 3D printing, (iii) surface treatment of the scaffold with plasma immersion ion implantation (PIII) techniques, (iv) ovine mandibular implantation, (v) postoperative sheep recovery, euthanasia, and harvesting of the scaffold and surrounding host bone, microCT scanning, and (vi) in vitro laboratory mechanical tests of the harvested scaffolds. The results of microCT imagery and 3-point mechanical bend testing demonstrate that PIII-SLS-PEK is a promising biomaterial for the manufacturing of scaffold implants to enhance the bone-scaffold contact and bone ingrowth in porous scaffold implants. MicroCT images of the harvested implant and surrounding bone tissue showed encouraging new bone growth at the scaffold-bone interface and inside the porous network of the lattice structure of the SLS-PEK scaffolds. © 2024 American Chemical Society.",3D printing; bone tissue engineering; mandibular defect; ossification; ovine model; poly ether ketone; scaffolds,"Animals; Biocompatible Materials; Finite Element Analysis; Mandible; Osteogenesis; Printing, Three-Dimensional; Sheep; Tissue Scaffolds; Biomechanics; Computer aided design; Computerized tomography; Ethers; Finite element method; Image enhancement; Ketones; Laser heating; Plasma applications; Polymeric implants; Scaffolds (biology); Sintering; Surface treatment; Tissue; Tissue regeneration; biomaterial; bupivacaine; cefazolin; ceftiofur; excede; fentanyl; ilium buccalgesic otm; isoflurane; isothesia nxt; ketamine; meloxicam; methadone; midazolam; morphine; morphine sulfate; polyetheretherketone; povidone iodine; propofol; 3-D printing; 3D-printing; Bone tissue engineering; In-silico; In-vitro; In-vivo; Mandibular defect; Ossification; Ovine model; Poly(ether ketone); adult; anesthesia; anesthetic recovery; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; anxiety disorder; Article; biomechanics; body size; bone conduction; bone growth; bone microarchitecture; bone regeneration; bone remodeling; bone structure; bone tissue; bone turnover; bone volume; capnometry; clinical protocol; computer aided design; computer assisted tomography; computer model; controlled study; cost; covalent bond; digital twin; distress syndrome; electrocardiography; female; finite element analysis; fused deposition modeling; hydrophilicity; hydrophobicity; immersion; implant complication; implantation; in vitro study; in vivo study; inferior alveolar artery; intermittent positive pressure ventilation; jaw malformation; mandible; masseter muscle; mechanical test; micro-computed tomography; muscle strength; non invasive procedure; nonhuman; ointment; ovine model; prediction; prophylaxis; pulse oximetry; rectal temperature; rigidity; risk; selective laser sintering; sheep; software; spirometry; surgical infection; tensile strength; thermostability; three dimensional printing; tissue engineering; wound closure; wound complication; wound dehiscence; animal; bone development; chemistry; diagnostic imaging; mandible; surgery; 3D printing",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85192234387

The volumetric stamping methods used ensure high productivity while maintaining product quality. Cold volumetric stamping is one of the main types of metal forming in many branches of mechanical engineering, as it most fully meets the requirements of approximating the shapes and sizes of workpieces to finished parts. Determining the rational technology of the stamping process is a fundamental factor in the development of the production of a new product. Hollow parts with a bottom of the ""glass"" type are usually obtained by direct or reverse extrusion. The maximum deformation and minimum wall thickness of the part in this case is determined depending on the technological deformability of the workpiece. The design of technological processes of cold volumetric stamping of thin-walled parts of the ""glass"" type involves solving a number of complex tasks: determination of the stress-strain state; determination of punching forces, loads, etc. The use of traditional methods of designing technological processes of cold volumetric stamping does not always allow us to solve these tasks and ensure the optimal combination of the required quality of the finished part and the minimum time and cost of production. One of the effective approaches to solving these problems is the use of computer-aided design systems based on computer technologies: CAD and SAE systems - software complexes for automated engineering analysis of volumetric stamping processes. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.

CAD-CAM techniques development has opened new broad horizons in the surgical planning of complex maxillofacial reconstructions, in terms of accuracy, predictability, and functional cosmetic results. The review of the literature has revealed a small number of scientific reports on total mandibulectomy including the condyles, with only eleven cases from 1980. Most of the works describe reconstructions secondary to dysplastic or inflammatory diseases affecting the lower jaw. The aim of this work, reporting a rare case of massive fibrous dysplasia of the whole mandible, is to share our experience in the management of extended mandibular and bilateral joint reconstruction, using porous titanium patient-specific implants. Case presentation: The authors present a 20-year-old male patient suffering from massive bone fibrous dysplasia of the mandible. The mandibular body and both the rami and the condylar processes had been involved, causing severe functional impairment, tooth loss, and facial deformation. The young patient, after repeated ineffective conservative surgical treatments, has required a biarticular mandibular replacement. Using virtual surgical planning (VSP) software, the authors, in collaboration with medical engineers, have created a custom-made original titanium porous mandibular implant, suspended from a bilateral artificial temporomandibular joint. The mandibular titanium implant body has been specifically designed to support soft tissues and to fix, in the alveolar region, a free fibular bone graft, for delayed dental implant prosthetic rehabilitation. Conclusion: The surgical and technical details, as well as the new trends in mandibular reconstructions using porous titanium implants, are reported, and discussed, reviewing literature reports on this topic.

This study investigates the aerodynamics and performance of the WG/EV100 micro–Horizontal Axis Wind Turbine (HAWT) using Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD). The complexity of VAWT aerodynamics, which is inherently unsteady and three-dimensional, makes high-fidelity flow models extremely demanding in terms of computational cost, limiting the analysis to mainly 2D Computational Fluid-Dynamics (CFD) approaches. This article explains how to perform a full 3D unsteady CFD simulation of HAWT. All main parts of the WG/EV100 HAWT were designed in SOLIDWORKS. Only the blade design was reverse engineered due to the unavailability of the CAD model and the complexity of its geometric characteristics. The impeller blade is scanned using a Coordi-nate Measuring Machine (CMM), and the obtained 3D scan data are exported from the PC-DMIS software to GEOMAGIC design X to obtain a CAD model of the blade. © 2023 The Author(s).

Likewise, several academic and research initiatives are reviewed. In this sense, this paper aims to establish an appropriate link between two agendas that the architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) industry, academia, and governments normally handle separately. By conducting several literature reviews (book, journals, and congresses) and extensive software tests (BIM software: Revit v2023, Archicad v27, Tekla, and wood plug-ins: AGACAD, Archiframe, Timber Framing 2015, WoodStud Frame, etc.), the state-of-the-art was assessed in both fields, and several cases linking BIM and wood are shown in detail and discussed. Various theoretical samples are modelled and shown, and the advantages and disadvantages of each technique and stage are explained. On the other hand, although wood construction has been most common for hundreds of years, this is not the case of BIM software developments associated with this materiality. Furthermore, since the appearance of materials such as steel and reinforced concrete, all software developments have focused on these materials, leaving aside the possibility of developing applications for use in wood projects. According to that previously discussed, it can be concluded that BIM for wood has been used more frequently in academia, that both fields have several common processes, and, in many cases, that only a few BIM-wood tools have been used, thus disregarding the high potential and high level of benefits that result with the application of these methodologies for the complete building life cycle (design, construction, and operation). © 2024 by the authors.",architectural design; building construction; building information modelling; CAD/CAM; timber construction; wood; wood construction,Application programs; Computer aided design; Information theory; Life cycle; Reinforced concrete; Software testing; Timber; Building construction; Building Information Modelling; Cad/cams; Design and construction; Modeling technology; Multi-disciplinary approach; State of the art; Timber construction; Wood construction; Wood design; Architectural design,Review,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85188842229

Mandibular dynamics studies the forces that occur between the contacts of the teeth in occlusion. Due to the importance of this issue, and taking advantage of the potential of finite element technology available in commercial software packages for industrial design, a study has been developed to calculate the magnitudes and directions of the contact forces. Considering the geometric complexity of a denture, simple geometries have been used instead of real teeth ones for a preliminary phase of the study. The development of the study consists of the next phases: creating or importing the geometry of the teeth, placing the teeth on a mandibular and a maxillary base, positioning the upper denture with respect to the lower one, setting a linear static analysis using finite elements method and establishing individualized contact conditions between the teeth, and finally obtaining and analyzing the results. The viability of the method has been tested with an example, and it has been verified that it is possible to calculate the dental contact forces for different occlusion scenarios and thus identify the existing problems. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.",Contact forces; FEM; Mandibular dynamics; Occlusion,Arches; Computer aided design; Computer aided engineering; Geometry; Product design; Static analysis; CAD/CAE; Commercial software; Contact forces; Dynamic studies; Finite element technology; Geometric complexity; Low-arch; Mandibular dynamic; Mechanical; Occlusion; Finite element method,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85192147398

Such defects should be considered during the design process or after production, where the defects could be detected with the help of computed tomography (CT) measurements. However, this is usually not done in today's mass production environments. This paper deals with the stress analysis of die-cast structural parts with pores found from CT measurements or that are artificially placed within a structure. Design/methodology/approach: In this paper the authors illustrate two general methodologies to take into account the porosity of die-cast components in the stress analysis. The detailed geometry of a die-cast part including all discontinuities such as pores and shrink holes can be included via STL data provided by CT measurements. The first approach is a combination of the finite element method (FEM) and the finite cell method (FCM), which extends the FEM if the real geometry cuts finite elements. The FCM is only applied in regions with pores. This procedure has the advantage that all simulations with different pore distributions, real or artificial, can be calculated without changing the base finite element mesh. The second approach includes the pore information as STL data into the original CAD model and creates a new adapted finite element mesh for the simulation. Both methods are compared and evaluated for an industrial problem. Findings: The STL data of defects which the authors received from CT measurements could not be directly applied without repairing them. Therefore, for FEM applications an appropriate repair procedure is proposed. The first approach, which combines the FEM with the FCM, the authors have realized within the commercial software tool Abaqus. This combination performs well, which is demonstrated for test examples, and is also applied for a complex industrial project. The developed in-house code still has some limitations which restrict broader application in industry. The second pure FEM-based approach works well without limitations but requires increasing computational effort if many different pore distributions are to be investigated. Originality/value: A new simulation approach which combines the FEM with the FCM has been developed and implemented into the commercial Abaqus FEM software. This approach the authors have applied to simulate a real engineering die-cast structure with pores. This approach could become a preferred way to consider pores in practical applications, where the porosity can be derived either from CT measurements or are artificially adopted for design purposes. The authors have also shown how pores can be considered in the standard FEM analysis as well. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Computed tomography (CT); Die-cast parts with pores; Finite cell method (FCM); Finite element method (FEM); Repair of STL data; STL data; Stress analysis,ABAQUS; Codes (symbols); Computer aided design; Computer aided software engineering; Computerized tomography; Die casting; Dies; Dynamic loads; Fracture mechanics; Mesh generation; Repair; Stress analysis; Cast part; Computed tomography; Die-cast; Die-cast part with pore; Finite cell method; Finite element method; Repair of STL data; STL data; Stresses analysis; Finite element method,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85165297513

The key objective is to store the whole system design in one single source of truth system model. The continuously maintained and customizable open-source MBSE tool Virtual Satellite developed by German Aerospace Center (DLR) offers a framework for storing such a system model. Since the open-source 3D computer aided design (CAD) software FreeCAD has a dedicated Virtual Satellite workbench for importing the 3D model file generated by Virtual Satellite, it is possible to export the 3D model from Virtual Satellite, apply changes to it in FreeCAD, and afterwards reimport it in Virtual Satellite. This paper presents a workflow implementation to conduct automated steady-state and transient thermal analyses using the Virtual Satellite system model as a basis, utilizing the aforementioned features. Part of this effort was to extend Virtual Satellite by thermal modeling capabilities, such as material parameters, surface characteristics, thermal interfaces, boundary conditions and further relevant aspects. With custom Java applications, so-called “Apps”, all aspects of the system model relevant for a thermal analysis are exported from Virtual Satellite and written to accordingly generated text files. Moreover, the before described 3D model export is used to export the model to FreeCAD. The FreeCAD Python console, in combination with the finite element method (FEM) workbench, is used to create a script that executes meshing, application of the boundary and initial conditions, as well as identification of contacts between parts and application of the specified contact conductance values. The obtained files form a complete thermal model and can be fed directly into the open-source FEM software CalculiX for executing the thermal analysis. Then, the result can be processed by an additional Virtual Satellite App. To account for the space thermal environment an additional feature was added to the FreeCAD script. The feature uses orbit information obtained from external mission analysis tools to calculate the approximate combined heat load from Sun, Earth infrared, and albedo radiation at each time point in the specified simulation time interval. This new workflow allows to execute quick thermal analyses at an early design stage and therefore opens new opportunities in the evaluation of different system designs, as early as in a concurrent engineering study. Configuration parameters are provided that also allow more sophisticated analyses in later development phases, such as custom mesh definition and local mesh refinement. © 2023 IAA",Model-based systems engineering (MBSE); Simulation; Thermal analysis,3D modeling; Computer aided design; Concurrent engineering; Open systems; Orbits; Python; Satellites; Software packages; Systems analysis; Thermal Engineering; Thermography (temperature measurement); 3D models; 3d-modeling; Model-based system engineering; Model-based system engineerings; Open-source; Open-source model; Simulation; System models; Thermal; Virtual satellite; Thermoanalysis,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85175429318

However, the rapid development of digital technologies in the automotive industry have enabled to properly model and simulate the full-vehicle dynamics, thus drastically reducing design and manufacturing times and costs while enhancing the performance, safety, and longevity of vehicle systems. This paper focus on a computationally efficient multi-objective optimization framework for developing an optimal design of a vehicle steering system, which is carried out by coupling certain computer-aided design tools (CAD) and computer-aided engineering (CAE) software. The 3D CAD model of the steering system is made using SolidWorks, the Finite Element Analysis (FEA) is modelled using Ansys Workbench, while the multibody kinematic and dynamic is analysed using Adams/Car. They are embedded in a multidisciplinary optimization design framework (modeFrontier) with the aim of determining the optimal hardpoint locations of the suspension and steering systems. This is achieved by minimizing the Ackermann error and toe angle deviations, together with the volume, mass, and maximum stresses of the rack-and-pinion steering mechanism. This enhances the vehicle stability, safety, manoeuvrability, and passengers’ comfort, extends the vehicle systems reliability and fatigue life, while reducing the tire wear. The method has been successfully applied to different driving scenarios and vehicle maneuvers to find the optimal Pareto front and analyse the performance and behaviour of the steering system. Results show that the design of the steering system can be significantly improved using this approach. © 2023, The Author(s).",,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85176221238

The primary objective of this study is to provide engineers and researchers with a robust and streamlined approach for the early stages of electric vehicle (EV) design, offering valuable insights into the performance, energy consumption, current flow, and thermal behavior of these advanced automotive systems. Recognizing the complex nature of contemporary EVs, the study highlights the need for efficient design tools that facilitate decision-making during the conceptual phases of development. The PerfECT Design Tool is presented as a multi-level framework, divided into four logically sequential modules: Performance, Energy, Currents, and Temperature. These modules are underpinned by sound theoretical foundations and are implemented using a combination of MATLAB/Simulink and the vehicle dynamics software VI-CRT. The research culminates in the validation of the model through a series of experimental maneuvers conducted with a Tesla Model 3, establishing its accuracy in representing the mechanical, electrical, and thermal behavior of BEVs. The study’s main findings underscore the viability of the design tool as an asset in the initial phases of BEV design. Beyond its primary application, the tool holds promise for broader utilization, including the development of active control systems, advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), and solutions for autonomous driving within the domain of electric vehicles. © 2023 by the author.",batteries; design methodology; electric powertrain; electric vehicles; modelling and simulation; vehicle dynamics,Advanced driver assistance systems; Automobile drivers; Decision making; MATLAB; Secondary batteries; Vehicle performance; Battery; Battery-electric vehicles; Design Methodology; Design tool; Electric power trains; Model and simulation; Thermal behaviours; Vehicle design; Vehicle modelling; Vehicle's dynamics; Energy utilization,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85180700819

The intermediate preforming impressions are used to achieve a complete finish die fill with minimal flash and reduced forming load while avoiding flow defects such as laps and flow-through. Practically effective preform design should also minimise the die wear by reducing metal sliding over the tool surface during impressions. In this paper we present a practical implementation of the approach to developing a preform shape that involves a potential flow approximation and utilising equipotential surfaces as a preliminary guess. This study continues the author’s previous work [1], which has been expanded to a broader range of product shapes. To make this approach applicable in the industry, a specialised CAD program was developed and tested in real production conditions that have proven its efficiency. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Design; Dies; Forging; Operations; Preforms; Simulation,Computer aided design; Dies; Software testing; Upsetting (forming); Billet shapes; Forging; Forging technologies; Hot forging; Multi-stages; Multiple operations; Operation; Preform; Preform design; Simulation; Preforming,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85171993904

Urban planners and designers use graphic and symbolic thinking. Yet, computer-aided design software accepts inputs by numeric parameters, while recent generative design tools focus on quantity rather than controllability, where in most cases there are ""black boxes"" hiding the algorithm and procedural logic behind the hood. As a result, there is an established need to tailor tools to the mindset of urban designers to make them more user-friendly and practical. To address this need, we develop a tool that takes the users' intuitive sketch as symbolic inputs to guide 3d urban form generation. It seamlessly combines symbolic thinking and urban form generation using ML-based gesture recognition middleware, and Tensor Field-based procedural urban network generation algorithm. The contribution of this work is: a review of urban generation algorithms and methods of human computation interaction, conceptual overview and methodology, and case study evaluation. We analyzed traditional and state-of-the-art urban design generative algorithms, such as cellular automata-based and machine learning image generation-based methods. It also compared different methods of human-computer interaction and selected appropriate urban design symbol systems. Combining both, the study develops a web-based interactive program backed by a Tensor Field-based procedural urban network generation algorithm, with JavaScript and React framework based on ML-based gesture recognition middleware. The research proposes a workflow for generative urban design. It further evaluates the possibility of integrating block or building scale, with generative architectural design platforms, to automatically refine and analyze rough urban volumes. Ultimately, this work points to a new future of tool development with tools that conform to the logic of urban growth while complying with the designer's mind. © 2024 and published by the Association for Computer-Aided Architectural Design Research in Asia (CAADRIA), Hong Kong.",creativity support tools; generative urban design; gesture recognition; procedural modeling; tensor fields; urban semiotics,Architectural design; Computer aided design; Computer circuits; Machine learning; Middleware; Urban growth; Websites; Creativity support; Creativity support tool; Generative urban design; Gestures recognition; Procedural models; Support tool; Tensor fields; Urban design; Urban designers; Urban semiotic; Computation theory,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85196750328

While most of the semiconductor industry and its consumers are becoming increasingly dependent on nanoelectronics, these devices are becoming more susceptible to defects and transient faults. Non-Visual Defects (NVD) is a category of semiconductor material and process induced defect that cause electrical failures but are not detected with visual wafer inspection tools (Findlay et al., 2016 [1] and Kim et al., 2009 [10]) or with fault localization tools. Devices with NVD may fail at any stage of their life cycle and may benefit from complex Failure Analysis (FA) investigations including software support to analyze design and diagnostic data. For a higher FA success rate, these investigations can be further supplemented with Technology Computer-Aided Design (TCAD) Process Simulation software to simulate a failure prior to actual physical analysis on limited device samples. In this work, we will showcase an innovative technique for simulating NVD using a 3D process model to pinpoint the exact process step where the defect was introduced. By injecting a new virtual defect layer (which can be autonomously introduced by an FA engineer) in the original device data, we can emulate the failing device.

To support these activities, AR interfaces need to be developed with instructions provided through visual assets tailored to the information to convey. For localization tasks, auxiliary models, i.e., standard geometric shapes are the most suited. In this work, we propose ADAM (Automatic Development of Auxiliary Models): an authoring tool to support designers in generating various shapes of auxiliary models in the right dimensions and without modeling them in a CAD software. Thanks to this tool, the designer has a ready-to-use database of auxiliary models to choose from reusable in different AR technical documentations. In this way, ADAM allows to significantly reduce the time spent creating each auxiliary model from scratch. We validated our tool in a user study. A focus group of expert designers were asked to implement an AR interface, using auxiliary models for a localization task, with both ADAM Tool and the current authoring practice. The results confirmed that our tool outperforms the current authoring practice in terms of time performance and user experience. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.",Augmented Reality; Authoring; Auxiliary Model; CAD; Technical Documentation,Computer aided design; User interfaces; 'current; Authoring; Authoring tool; Auxiliary models; CAD softwares; Geometric shape; Localisation; Ready to use; Reality interface; Technical documentations; Augmented reality,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85193629102

Globally, it is one of the technologies with the fastest growth rates due to its capability to produce simple and extremely convoluted geometries, its use of essentially any kind of resources, and the development of innovative designs from large-scale bulk production to even small production. AM creates shapes by designing with computer-aided design (CAD) software, or by scanning items using tomography techniques. The primary attribute of AM is the reduced steps of production processes between the virtual design and the finished part. The great potential, with its flexibility through different materials, like pure metals and metal alloys with small thicknesses, ceramics, thermoplastics, composites, and metals is enormous. For clinical applications, AM offers great customizability based on the data and needs of each unique patient ranging from vascular structures, implants, and soft tissues to even foreign bodies. AM is frequently employed for quick prototyping, complicated geometry, fabrication of several integrated parts, improved performance, and low-volume manufacture. The advantages include greater automation, easy availability of CAM/CAD design tools, and an expanding library of printable materials. AM’s importance was easily spotted at the earliest by the healthcare sector, which recognized the technology’s special capability to provide mass device customization and complex geometry, especially in therapeutic delivery, medical device manufacturing, tissue engineering and regeneration, and operative management planning.

Compared with traditional hand-drawing, it can create and modify graphics more quickly, saving time and human resources. Image synthesis can provide a realistic visual experience for our products. Due to different design requirements, the 3D modeling and rendering of different product designs will also be different. There are some special things to pay attention to when rendering metal materials. To better blend into the background and ensure realistic rendering, it is crucial to choose the correct metal material settings. Metal often reflects and refracts surrounding objects, and you need to ensure that objects in the scene can be reflected and refracted on the metal surface. This helps increase the realism of your rendering. Therefore, properties such as reflectivity, glossiness, roughness, and refractive index need to be adjusted. With CAD and rendering tools, students can transform their ideas into actual 3D models, thereby enhancing their design creativity. This study will provide some basic usage tips of Fusion 360 and the rendering software KeyShot and how to make the rendering products more realistic.

Product-oriented Work Breakdown Structure (PWBS)-based steel ship production technology has played a vital role in the shipyard’s success in competition. A block and modular assembly approach using the PWBS method was prepared to guide shipyards. This paper presents a study on the technology capability of four selected Indonesian medium-sized shipyards and one leading shipyard as the benchmark in using the PWBS method. The technology capability in shipbuilding is measured using the technometric assessment model by the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (UNESCAP), which consists of four indicators; technoware, humanware, infoware, and orgaware. The results show that the shipyards’ Technology Coefficient Contribution (TCC) is between 0.5 and 0.7 (TCC maximum 1.0). This value indicates that the four shipyards in this case study are capable of building ships based on PWBS method. However, some aspects have to be improved to ensure the method is implemented properly, including: better design software that could prepare comprehensive production engineering documents, production lane with more automation, and more crane capacity. Of course, large additional investments must be supported by continuous orders for new ships with relatively the same type and size of ships, so that they are more productive and gradually able to compete in the global market. © 2023 The Author(s).

Traditional constraints on composite laminate stacking sequences, such as the symmetrical and balanced nature of classical quasi-isotropic laminates, often lead to over-dimensioning of aeronautical components. To overcome these limitations, the adoption of a new class of laminates known as Double-Double laminates, originally introduced by Prof. S.W. Tsai, is proposed. Unlike traditional laminates, Double-Double laminates offer flexibility in layer orientations, small building blocks, easy homogenization, and tapering capability. This study presents various case studies of increasing complexity to assess the effectiveness of the proposed methodology. First, a multicopter frame is redesigned to reveal the methodology's ability to reduce component weight while ensuring strength requirements under typical service loads. Then, the “DD Automated Design Tool”, a newly developed Finite Element Method tool interfacing with the Lamsearch engine, is introduced. This tool facilitates the rapid identification of optimal composite double-double laminate layups based on material properties, applied loads, and boundary conditions. By iteratively interacting between the Finite Element Method software and the Lamsearch engine, the tool efficiently identifies the best laminate angles to meet specific strength requirements. To validate the weight-saving capability of the proposed methodology, the optimizations on a composite fuselage section and a real composite wing-box under realistic loading conditions have been carried out.

Septic tank designs are bound in order to reduce health risks associated with improperly treated effluent especially in developing countries and also for the development of human civilization. The main objective of this research is to reduce the economical cost of Septic tank. This study can reduce the efficient cost and time for the construction of septic tank by analyzing the effects and consequences of different types of problem occurs during the structural construction. In this research, analytical results are being calculated through CAD/STAAD software. The study concludes that the construction of the septic tank through brick masonry and RCC approach have a small difference in terms of economic cost but the RCC design approach is very much efficient as compare to Brick masonry as the tank is more secure and durable in RCC design.

In this study, a range of angles of attack and airfoil Configurations are considered. A comprehensive simulation study is carried out to understand the aerodynamic performance and flow pattern, as well as wake development characteristics, of a NACA0012 airfoil with WLE at low speeds and various angles of attack. NACA airfoils is selected because of the wide-spread use in turbomachinery and also due to the aerodynamic efficiency. Three models of WLE airfoils with three different amplitudes are constructed using computer-aided design (CAD) software, CATIA and they are then used for the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation analysis. For the simulation setup, Reynolds number of the air flow is set to 400,000 and angle of attack is varied from 0° to 20° with increment of 1°. The lift and drag coefficients and flow structures are recorded and compared with that for the baseline NACA0012 airfoil. Overall, the numerical results indicate that the three airfoils with WLE have significantly increased lift and drag coefficients in the post-stall region in which the lift increases up to about 13.5% more than that of the NACA0012 for angles of attack greater than 18° and have a much soft stall process with low abrupt loss of lift. However, at low angles of attack, the performance of conventional NACA0012 airfoil and WLE airfoils does not differ significantly. This is due to fact that the wavy shape of the airfoil’s leading edge creates a small amount of turbulence in the airflow over its surface. This advantage could lead the WLE airfoils to be used in the applications of turbomachinery such as horizontal-axis-wind turbines (HAWT) © 2024 The Aeronautical and Astronautical Society of the Republic of China.

Here, we introduce DexDesign, a novel OSPREY-based algorithm for computationally designing de novo D-peptide inhibitors. DexDesign leverages three novel techniques that are broadly applicable to computational protein design: the Minimum Flexible Set, K∗-based Mutational Scan, and Inverse Alanine Scan. We apply these techniques and DexDesign to generate novel D-peptide inhibitors of two biomedically important PDZ domain targets: CAL and MAST2. We introduce a framework for analyzing de novo peptides—evaluation along a replication/restitution axis—and apply it to the DexDesign-generated D-peptides.

Deployed sensors may not perform as intended due to the heterogeneity of USSN devices’ hardware and software when combined with the Internet. Hence, USSNs are regarded as complex distributed systems. As such, USSN designers will encounter challenges throughout the design phase related to time, complexity, sharing diverse domain experiences (viewpoints), and ensuring optimal performance for the deployed USSNs. Accordingly, during the USSN development and deployment phases, a few Underwater Environmental Constraints (UECs) should be taken into account. These constraints may include the salinity level and the operational depth of every physical component (sensor, server, etc.) that will be utilized throughout the duration of the USSN information systems’ development and implementation. To this end, in this article we present how we integrated an Artificial Intelligence (AI) Database, an extended ArchiMO meta-model, and a design tool into our previously proposed Enterprise Architecture Framework. This addition proposes adding new Underwater Environmental Constraints (UECs) to the AI Database, which is accessed by USSN designers when they define models, with the goal of simplifying the USSN design activity. This serves as the basis for generating a new version of our ArchiMO design tool that includes the UECs. To illustrate our proposal, we use the newly generated ArchiMO to create a model in the MO domain. Furthermore, we use our self-developed domain-specific model compiler to produce the relevant simulation code. Throughout the design phase, our approach contributes to the handling and controling of the uncertainties and variances of the provided quality of service that may occur during the performance of the USSNs, as well as reducing the design activity’s complexity and time. It provides a way to share the different viewpoints of the designers in the domain of USSNs. © 2024 by the authors.",ArchiMate; Domain-Specific Modeling Languages; Enterprise Architecture; IIoUT; IMS; Marine Observatories; NS-3; Smart Fusion Servers; Smart Sensors,Modeling languages; Network architecture; Observatories; Smart sensors; montirelin; Archimate; Domain specific modeling languages; Domain-Specific Modelling Languages; Enterprise Architecture; IIoUT; IMS; Marine observatories; NS-3; Smart fusion server; Smart sensor networks; article; artificial intelligence; deep sea; drug development; duration; human; Internet; salinity; sensor; simulation; software; Sensor networks,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85191389179

The basic problem addressed by this project was the need for a convenient and efficient way to clean floors without manual labour. The specific objective was to create a robot that could clean floors autonomously while avoiding obstacles and accurately sensing its surroundings. The scope of the work involved designing a robot that could handle a variety of floor types and sizes, while minimizing water usage and maximizing battery life. Through this paper, we are identifying and analyzing some of the pre-existing model and proposing some modification changes, to take up this challenge. We have focused on features, applications, mechanisms, constraints of the Robot. To accomplish this objective, the robot was designed with a combination of hardware and software components. The hardware consisted of a base platform, a water tank and pump system, sensors for navigation and obstacle avoidance, and a microcontroller to control the robot's movements. Methodologies for motion planning, object recognition, including water consumption minimization were integrated inside the application. CAD model is used to model the robotic cleaner for the home. By using CAD application and model parameters to assess deformation, equivalence (von-misses) stress, and shear stress, a finite element analysis (FEA) was carried out to determine the change of stress at crucial regions of the system. The successful completion of this assigned task has produced project data for the creation of an affordable, easy, secure, and effective house cleaning robot. Through extensive testing and experimentation, the major results showed that the floor mopping robot was able to effectively clean floors of different types and sizes, while accurately avoiding obstacles.

Through the analysis of the characteristics of PC balcony components and the combination of modular design methods, the paper designed a data structure for the components and developed a data-driven modeling tool for PC balcony components that can realize the input of structural design data, automatically generating component models. First, this paper introduced the data-driven modeling concept and the modeling process. Second, the PC balcony components in common prefabricated residential projects were analyzed to identify their characteristics. By using a modular design approach, these components were divided and a module dataset was created based on the split modules. Consequently, a data structure for the prefabricated balcony component model was established, wherein both conventional parameters and adaptive parameters between modules were interrelated. Finally, the function of data-driven modeling was achieved by developing a modular design tool on the Revit platform using the C# programming language. The application conducted on a prefabricated building project demonstrated that the software tool and modeling method in this paper effectively improve the level of informatization and modeling efficiency of PC balcony components.

Many apparel designers prefer this tangible process rather than the more abstract process of drafting patterns in 2D using CAD software, but the visualization benefits of 3D rendering remain important to product development. Currently, draped patterns must be manually digitized to transfer the shape to the CAD environment, a cumbersome process. Here, we explore augmenting the fabric used to drape patterns with e-textile components, such that pinning the fabric to the form directly digitizes the pattern shape. The e-textile interface uses a keypad matrix approach with rows and columns on opposite sides of the fabric. Passing a metallic pin through a row/column intersection creates a circuit connection that a microcontroller reads and maps to a 2D spatial layout on the screen. The proof-of-concept device developed here is a first step toward an automatic digitizing system that allows designers to preserve manual skills and processes while integrating more efficiently with digital systems. © 2023 Owner/Author.",Draping; E-textile interface; Keypad matrix; Patternmaking,Smart textiles; Three dimensional computer graphics; 3-D rendering; Abstract process; CAD softwares; Draping; E-textile interface; Interactive interfaces; Keypad matrix; matrix; Pattern shape; Textile Interfaces; Computer aided design,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85175479481

However, our previous system did not support design improvement using mock techniques, and test target components to be practiced are limited. Furthermore, component design with mock techniques is related to learning object-oriented design concepts. It is an important element for learners to perform their software development using the test-driven development (TDD) approach. Therefore, in this study, we extended the system to support learning for designing the test target component using mock techniques.

Currently, 8 provincial governments representing over 95% of Canada’s population allow private companies to create their own electronic medical records (EMR) system and integrate with provincial BLD systems. This study found the cost to develop and maintain HermesAPI would be between CAD$610,000 to CAD$740,000, but would prevent CAD$120,000 per company per province in development costs for a total savings of $6.4 million. HermesAPI would lower barriers to entry for the HIT industry to increase competition, improve the quality of HIT products, and ultimately patient care.

The resulting 3D scene is then used to perform shadowing, solar and wind analyses that are used by architects and engineers in their preliminary development phases of the project. The work stems from a preliminary analysis in terms of data and software requirements carried out between practitioners from both the GIS and AEC domain.

Most web learning applications generate tests with single, multiple, or text answers, or the use of closed-solution problems where only the student’s final answer is validated. The complexity increases when we try to score a text, but the most difficult evaluation is in the field of Graphic Engineering, inside CAD/CAM environments. The student assessment usually uses the revision of a digital file with a solution. While it is true that some software may offer tools to compare files, these are focused on the search for differences in their own versioning. When the 3D industrial model is created by students, the tools, planes or geometric sketches are very varied, and an automated assessment is not a simple task.

The Semantic Web stack including Web Ontology Language (OWL) and Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL) offers promising formats to represent data and rules for engineering knowledge sharing and reuse. However, many KBE applications for product design treat ontology-based knowledge bases as graph databases, often neglecting the reasoning abilities provided by the Semantic Web stack. Consequently, design rules, especially those concerning the (re)construction of geometric models, are frequently encapsulated as black-box processes within KBE systems. This type of reuse tends to result in non-cohesive solutions, where fragments of relevant knowledge, especially about the (re)construction of geometric models, are dispersed across various locations. This article demonstrates an approach to realizing the automated product design facilitated by semantically representing engineering knowledge using OWL and SWRL. This approach enables the construction of a cohesive knowledge base, leveraging the reasoning capabilities provided by the Semantic Web stack. Notably, the (re)construction of geometric models can be achieved using KBE language code snippets and the string processing capabilities of SWRL. To demonstrate this approach, a shaft design case, frequently used in research on product design, serves as a demonstrator to provide conceptual proof. The resulting geometric models are generated in KBE languages compatible with Siemens NX and AVEVA design software and can be visualized through interaction with the Computer-aided Design (CAD) kernel. This showcases the potential for seamless integration and knowledge sharing in the realm of product design through the application of the Semantic Web stack and KBE. © 2024 The Author(s)",Black-box; Computer-Aided Design; Knowledge-Based Engineering; Ontology; Product design; Semantic Web Rule Language,Birds; Computer aided design; Geometry; Knowledge based systems; Knowledge management; Product design; Semantic Web; Black boxes; Computer-aided design; Geometric models; Knowledge-based engineering; Ontology's; Re constructions; Rules languages; Semantic web rule language; Semantic Web rules; Semantic-Web; Ontology,Article,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85193428555

Developers and other stakeholders are often located in different locations, departments, and countries and operating within different time zones. Most online software design and modeling tools are not adequate for distributed collaboration since they do not support awareness and lack features for effective communication. Objective: The aim of our research is to support distributed software design activities in Virtual Reality (VR). Method: Using design science research methodology, we design and evaluate a tool for collaborative design in VR. We evaluate the collaboration efficiency and recall of design information when using the VR software design environment compared to a non-VR software design environment. Moreover, we collect the perceptions and preferences of users to explore the opportunities and challenges that were incurred by using the VR software design environment. Results: We find that there is no significant difference in the efficiency and recall of design information when using the VR compared to the non-VR environment. Furthermore, we find that developers are more satisfied with collaboration in VR. Conclusion: The results of our research and similar studies show that working in VR is not yet faster or more efficient than working on standard desktops.

Nowadays, it is possible to exploit of modern preoperative planning software, increasingly precise radiographic examinations (CBCT) and CAD/CAM technologies that allow designing devices directly on the computer to be sent to a milling center which produces the desired product, such as stereolithographic templates. METHODS: The prospective clinical study in question aims to evaluate the accuracy between two different surgical guides using peek and metal guide bushings. Twenty-nine implants were placed: for the control group, 17 3i, T3 implants were used, while for the test group, 12 Xive S plus implants were used. RESULTS: The result obtained shows that the deviations in the distribution of the control group and the test group are the same in the apical-coronal, vestibulo-palatal and mesio-distal direction. For the control group, the mean deviation was 1.394±0.644923 at the entry point of the implants and 1.85655±1.0765 at the most apical point of the implants. For the test group the mean deviation was 1.10157±0.312721 at the entry point of the implants and 1.54514±0.572100 at the most apical point of the implants. CONCLUSIONS: The peek guide bushings have the same deviation as the metal ones. There is no difference in the method used, but precision must be sought in other elements, such as the patient's anatomy and maximum precision in the guide production phase. © 2023 EDIZIONI MINERVA MEDICA.","Dental implants; Dentistry; Surgery, oral; Video-assisted surgery","Benzophenones; Cone-Beam Computed Tomography; Dental Implantation, Endosseous; Dental Implants; Humans; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Polymers; Prospective Studies; Surgery, Computer-Assisted; chlorhexidine; chlorhexidine gluconate; mepivacaine; vasoconstrictor agent; benzophenone derivative; polyetheretherketone; polymer; accuracy; adult; anesthesia; antibiotic therapy; Article; cone beam computed tomography; edentulism; edentulous jaw; guided surgery; human; implant precision; implantation; osteotomy; stereolithography; tooth implantation; computer assisted surgery; procedures; prospective study; three-dimensional imaging; tooth implantation",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85187202502

Often, however, these resources do not fit well into classroom teaching practice due to their orientation, length, or portability. This scarcity of didactic resources is more evident in the face of some teaching challenges such as the promotion of a research vocation, support in difficult content or help to overcome the gap between academic and professional perspectives. The search, selection or development of the most appropriate resources requires a strong dedication on the part of teachers. For this reason, the resources should be easily reusable in as many courses as possible. This communication describes the experience of a group of professors from the Area of Thermal Machines and Engines in the implementation of a hybrid bank of didactic resources oriented to the teaching of Energy and Sustainability Engineering. The process of bank design, application, and evaluation is illustrated using four of the resources produced: a demonstration of Nukiyama's experiment, a collection of heat transfer review videos, an introductory thermography hands-on session, and a class contest about fuel cell operation. The empirical findings suggest an enhancement in students’ academic performance, with mean grades increasing by 1.1/10–4.2/10, as well as in self-perceived learning. The suggested approach aims to improve students’ grasp of essential content, creating a more efficient and captivating learning environment. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.",Demonstration class; Practical class; Teaching innovation; Video learning,Computer aided instruction; Computer software reusability; Fuel cells; Heat transfer; Laboratories; Students; Sustainable development; Teaching; Classroom teaching; Demonstration class; Didactic resources; Energy engineering; Laboratory equipments; Materials Laboratory; Practical class; Teaching innovations; Video learning; Video simulation; Employment,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85193597344

This paper proposes an approach for training students in design software. We aim to understand whether alternative methods for teaching Adobe Photoshop, Illustrator, and InDesign to undergraduate students could effectively replace traditional approaches. We conducted a comparative study with first-semester students: two groups underwent training following traditional methods (lectures followed by in-class exercises), whereas two groups learned using the eduScrum methodology. For the latter approach, students were given 15 assignments to be developed during the semester, with complete freedom on where and how to research the necessary knowledge to achieve the required results. During this process, the instructor acted as a facilitator rather than an instructor, as the Scrum methodology advocates. As we foresaw, some of the tools studied during the semester were surpassed by software updates Adobe introduced, thus adding to our initial argument for developing the methodology in the first place. While we firmly believe that the eduScrum methodology can become a successful approach for teaching design software, further studies are necessary to investigate whether a hybrid methodology might be a better solution to help students transition to a more independent way of learning. © 2024, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Alternative Pedagogical Methods; Design; Design education; Design Software; eduScrum,,Book chapter,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85179711039

Recently, small design standards and the possibility of regular exposure of the device to radiation in conditions of energy efficient production has become particularly relevant. Hence, this requires the creation of special libraries and test environment tools. The structures of microcircuit design processes are presented at the top level and at the level of complex functional blocks. A functional modeling diagram is shown. Combined hardware and software verification, its features and problems are analyzed. It is shown that the main elements are libraries, debugging tools and a test environment.

However, traditional pedagogies often fail to engage learners fully and provide real-world, experiential learning. This paper presents a novel approach to climate change education through a three-day virtual reality (VR) hackathon. The hackathon focused on four United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)—Quality Education, Affordable and Clean Energy, Sustainable Cities and Communities, and Climate Action. Using VR technology and game design software, engineering students worked in teams. They competed against each other in designing immersive environments that demonstrated their understanding of these SDGs and climate change. Our goal was to encourage the development of empathy, education, and awareness around these critical global issues. The hackathon also integrated authentic assessments, mirroring real-world engineering tasks and providing a more practical and relevant learning experience. Our findings suggest that this VR hackathon has significantly enhanced students’ understanding of the SDGs and climate change issues, their competency with VR technologies, as well as their teamwork and problem-solving skills.

The study aims to elucidate the fundamental elements of contextual knowledge regularly employed by practicing engineers in their daily design endeavours, specifically in 3D CAD modelling. A transcendental phenomenology approach was used, and four engineers from the engineering department of a shipbuilding company in Peninsular Malaysia were purposefully selected as respondents. The analysis yielded three recurring themes central to the application of contextual knowledge in visualizing and presenting models through 3D CAD modelling: Realization, Design Intention, and Normalization.

Such advanced design tasks require support by computational tools but at the same time put high demands on their flexibility and expressivity to model the application-specific requirements. To address such demands, we present the computational framework Infrared. It supports developing advanced customized design tools, which generate RNA sequences with specific properties, often in a few lines of Python code. This text guides the reader in tutorial format through the development of complex design applications. Thanks to the declarative, compositional approach of Infrared, we can describe this development as a step-by-step extension of an elementary design task. Thus, we start with generating sequences that are compatible with a single RNA structure and go all the way to RNA design targeting complex positive and negative design objectives with respect to single or even multiple target structures. Finally, we present a “real-world” application of computational design to create an RNA device for biotechnology: we use Infrared to generate design candidates of an artificial “AND” riboswitch, which activates gene expression in the simultaneous presence of two different small metabolites. In these applications, we exploit that the system can generate, in an efficient (fixed-parameter tractable) way, multiple diverse designs that satisfy a number of constraints and have high quality w.r.t. to an objective (by sampling from a Boltzmann distribution). © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2024.",Boltzmann sampling; Declarative modeling; Fixed-parameter tractable sampling; Multi-target design; RNA design,Biotechnology; Computational Biology; Nucleic Acid Conformation; Riboswitch; RNA; Software; RNA; DNA base composition; gene expression; infrared radiation; medical documentation; partition coefficient; riboswitch; RNA sequence; RNA structure; bioinformatics; biotechnology; chemistry; conformation; genetics; procedures; software,Book chapter,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85194016081

Enterprise applications increasingly make intensive use of AI technologies and are often based on multiple components running across a computing continuum. However, the heterogeneity of the technologies and software development solutions in use are evolving quickly and are still a challenge for researchers and practitioners. Indeed, lack of solutions tailored for AI applications is observed in the areas of applications placement and design space exploration with performance guarantees, both under-developed. The aim of the AI-SPRINT “Artificial Intelligence in Secure PRIvacy-preserving computing coNTinuum” project is to develop a framework composed of design and runtime management tools to seamlessly design, partition and operate Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications among the current plethora of cloud-based solutions and AI-based sensor devices (i.e., devices with intelligence and data processing capabilities), providing resource efficiency, performance, data privacy, and security guarantees. AI-SPRINT is intended to accelerate the development of AI applications, whose components are spread across the edge-cloud computing continuum, while allowing trading-off application performance and AI models accuracy. This is accomplished by the thorough suite of design tools provided by the AI-SPRINT framework, which exposes a set of programming abstractions with the goal of hiding as much as possible the computing continuum complexity, while further providing a simple interface to define desired constraints upon which the application design is guided. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.",,Artificial intelligence; Computer programming; Information management; Privacy-preserving techniques; Application design; Application placements; Artificial intelligence technologies; Design frameworks; Development solutions; Edge computing; Enterprise applications; ICT industries; Multiple components; Runtime frameworks; Software design,Book chapter,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85191299027

The authors also discuss a method of mathematical derivation of the rejected product coefficient via equations describing the proposed product input–output model. Such derivation could contribute to the aggregation of the product and organizational–technological input–output model in the future. The proposed model was tested for batch production of square agricultural silos. For this purpose, a digital model of the factory was also created, intended for creation of production activity simulations. The simulation of the production process represents an effective tool not only for the needs of testing the proposed methodologies but also for the creation of initial data intended for the used input–output model.

This technique allows to apply fibre reinforced concrete (FRC) of strain softening (SSFRC) and strain hardening (SHFRC) according to a multi-level advanced numerical simulation that considers the relevant nonlinear features of these FRC, as well as their interaction with the surrounding soil, for an intended strengthening performance of the RT. Building information modelling (BIM) is used for assisting on the development of data files of the involved design software, integrating geometric assessment of a RT, damages from inspection and diagnosis, and the characteristics of the FRS strengthening solution. A dedicated computational tool was developed to design FRC with target properties. The preliminary experimental results on the evaluation of the relevant mechanical properties of the FRS are presented and discussed, as well as the experimental tests on the bond between FRS and current substrates found in RT. Representative numerical simulations were performed to demonstrate the structural performance of the proposed FRS-based strengthening technique. Computational tools capable of assuring, in real time, the aimed thickness of the layers forming the FRS strengthening shell were also developed. The first generation of a mechanical device for controlling the amount of fibres to be added, in real time, to the FRS mixture was conceived, built and tested. A mechanism is also being developed to improve the fibre distribution during its introduction through the mechanical device to avoid fibre balling.

Gearboxes are complex, expensive, and critical components of WT, which are subject to high maintenance costs and several stresses, including high loads and harsh environments, that can lead to failure with significant downtime and financial losses. This paper focuses on the development of a digital twin-based approach for the modelling and simulation of WT gearboxes with the aim to improve their design, diagnosis, operation, and maintenance by providing insights into their behavior under different operating conditions. Powerful commercial computer-aided design tools (CAD) and computer-aided engineering (CAE) software are embedded into a computationally efficient multi-objective optimization framework (modeFrontier) with the purpose of maximizing the power density, compactness, performance, and reliability of the WT gearbox. High-fidelity models are used to minimize the WT weight, volume, and maximum stresses and strains achieved without compromising its efficiency. The 3D CAD model of the WT gearbox is carried out using SolidWorks (version 2023 SP5.0), the Finite Element Analysis (FEA) is used to obtain the stresses and strains, fields are modelled using Ansys Workbench (version 2024R1), while the multibody kinematic and dynamic system is analyzed using Adams Machinery (version 2023.3, Hexagon). The method has been successfully applied to different case studies to find the optimal design and analyze the performance of the WT gearboxes. The simulation results can be used to determine safety factors, predict fatigue life, identify potential failure modes, and extend service life and reliability, thereby ensuring proper operation over its lifetime and reducing maintenance costs. © 2024 by the authors.",digital twin; finite element analysis; gearbox; multi-objective optimization; multibody simulation; structural optimization; wind turbine,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85192748004

The estimation of this measurand is a problem already solved by surveying engineering, but the quantification of its uncertainty has been overlooked. As a result, the inaccurate estimation of the volume can lead to significant deviations in the execution costs of earthworks. Moreover, it is not possible to comply with the internationally accepted requirements concerning the expression of measures with an indication of its uncertainty, i.e. the guidelines of the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures. In this context, this paper presents a methodology for the quantification of uncertainty in the surveying measurement of volumes, which is generally carried out through digital terrain models processed by computer-aided design or specific surveying software. Two methods for volume estimation are presented and the variance-covariance propagation laws are applied to each of them, leading to the computation of volume uncertainty from measures of position coordinates for which uncertainties are known. Then, the developed methods for uncertainty estimation are successfully tested in different scenarios. The conceptual and mathematical developments for the uncertainty quantification in the computation of volumes resulted in closed-form algorithms implemented in MATLAB that can be potentially incorporated into commercial surveying software. © 2024 IOP Publishing Ltd.",digital elevation model (DEM); surveying and CAD; uncertainty; volume measurement,Computer aided design; Surveying; Uncertainty analysis; Volume measurement; Bureau international des poids et mesures; Civil engineering works; Construction works; Digital elevation model; Execution costs; Measurand; Surveying and CAD; Uncertainty; Uncertainty estimation; MATLAB,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85182393532

We examine how the progress of digital technologies and the development of multiple computer-aided design (CAD) software had brought the possibility of determining the desired outcome before any dental treatment is performed, providing guidance for a patient-specific interdisciplinary and minimally invasive treatment plan. We access the use of different CAD software for planning every step of complex dental treatments. Recent Findings: Foreseeing the final outcome of dental treatments, by using distinct CAD software, allows early identification of specific treatment necessities, such as crown lengthening or other surgical procedures, orthodontic movements, and placement of indirect restorations. Also, it allows the doctors to visualize how each treatment influences further dental procedures. Computer technology is transforming the way we perform dentistry. It allows the conversion of what were previously pure manual tasks into easier, faster, sometimes cheaper, and more predictable mechanized processes. Facial and intra-oral scanners along with CAD software programs allow the integration of digitally-acquired patient information and the creation of a “virtual patient.” With patients’ virtual representation and by using several different CAD software, diagnostic and treatment planning can be made much more accurate, especially in complex clinical situations. Summary: The present article discusses how digital technologies and different CAD software programs can positively influence complex treatment planning and help avoiding complications. Starting from patient data acquisition using digital tools, to the integration of data, leading to the creation of a virtual patient, that allows using 2D and 3D CAD software to obtain precise treatment plans, optimized to the specific conditions of each patient.

We illustrate the model integration through a case study that links an existing nature-based solution (NbS) development, the PTT Metro Forest Park, Bangkok, Thailand, with theoretical new-build NbS for an adjacent property. A BIM school building was virtually situated on an empty lot beside the Metro Forest Park and seven NbS scenarios were run with design storms having 2-year, 5-year, and 100-year return intervals. The combination of a rain garden, permeable pavement, a retention pond, and a green roof was effective in sustainably managing runoff from the theoretical new-build site discharging to the Metro Forest. NbS design characteristics such as rain garden substrate depth and green roof area were optimized using the hydrologic/hydraulic model. Model results showed that even with the 100-year rainfall event, the existing Metro Forest pond storage capacity was sufficient so that flooding on the property would not occur. The consideration of connectivity between NbS features is facilitated by the modeling approach, which is important for NbS planning and assessment at a regional scale. © 2024 by the authors.",building information modeling; green roof; nature-based solution design; PCSWMM; pervious pavement; rain garden; sustainable urban water management,Bangkok; Central Region [Thailand]; Forest Park; Krung Thep Mahanakhon; New York [New York (STT)]; New York [United States]; Thailand; Thailand; United States; architectural design; hydrological modeling; landscape structure; runoff; software; stormwater; urban planning; water management,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85192785894

Based on optimized solutions, the company can decrease manufacturing costs, lead times or, more generally, increase benefit. However, when developing a new process, you must be sure that the new solution will add more value to the initial solution. This, among many others, is one of the main reasons why companies opt, in addition to experimentation, for the use of tools that allow for the virtual prototyping, simulation, and integration of complex and sophisticated processes. Experimentation requires approximation testing, searching for the ideal values of quantity, temperature, etc.; simulation provides industrial processes with test support ranging from flows to robotic systems such as the intelligent software. This simulation software allows to develop programs, add Computer Aided Design (CAD) layouts, and simulate the cycle times of the different tasks to be performed. In this paper, an experimental approach is presented with atomization and fan spray pressure as the study basis and a simulation of the robot-based handling solution used in a tyre production line.

The problems of modern CAD systems that provide similar functionality, methods and approaches to building software modules for automating route design based on advanced scientific developments in this area are considered. An approach to route design based on network programming methods, graph theory and a probabilistic approach to meeting the specified requirements for the accuracy and quality of the machined surface is proposed. The approach involves the reduction of existing reference data on various parameters of the cutting process into a single structure - “tables of accuracy”. Using the methods of mathematical statistics, the probability of achieving certain quality indicators for various machining methods is estimated. Thus, the issue of route design comes down to solving an optimization problem with a number of restrictions (the probability of achieving the required operational properties of the surface, the range of machine tools, etc.) and the objective function - for example, the cost, the shortest route in terms of the number of technological operations and technological installations, etc. An approach is also proposed for integrating such a system in parallel with the process of designing and layout of technological documentation, linking to an electronic digital model of a part (electronic product passport). © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.",Dimensional analysis; Machine-building CAD; Route design; Technological process of machining,Computer aided design; Machine tools; Product design; Statistics; CAD system; Dimensional analysis; Machine building; Machine-building CAD; Mechanical processing; Processing machines; Route design; Software modules; Technological process; Technological process of machining; Graph theory,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85181983037

The CMM is designed to place/remove the divertor cassettes which are near the RH ports into/from the vessel; the CTM is, instead, designed to move the cassettes which are distant from an RH port inside the vessel toroidally. To date, CMM is under a more advanced development stage of design with respect to CTM. This article describes and illustrates in detail the virtual kinematic simulations of the CMM operative procedures. With regard to the CTM, only preliminary simulations are presented. These activities are part of the integration and verification stages of the CMM design process, carried out in a Systems Engineering approach and following the workflow prescribed by the V-model and its requirements, functions, logical, and physical architecture (RFLP) paradigm. Therefore, after an introduction to the CMM requirements, functions, and conceptual design, which have already been developed, the article focuses on the description of its virtual kinematic simulations and the analysis of their results, with the aim of verifying the feasibility of the handling procedures and the correct integration of the CMM in the surrounding environment, considering all the in-vessel geometric constraints. The simulations have been carried out following a forward-kinematics approach. Therefore, each simulation has been divided into a series of consecutive activities, assigning each of them a set of values for the five CMM joints able to reach the required final position of the end-effector. The software DELMIA, part of the Dassault Syst&#x00E8;mes V5 platform which also includes the software for CAD modeling CATIA V5, has been used to perform the simulations. As for the CTM operation, since its concept design has not been completed yet, preliminary virtual kinematic simulations have been performed with a different goal: to evaluate alternative possible operative strategies, which can impact the device design.

However, this patina effect can also be created artificially by using specific products to rub the leather surface. This research presents a new and innovative method to automate the process of creating patina on leather footwear using collaborative robots. These types of finishing tasks on medium size objects are delicate and often require adjustments by skilled craftsmen, adding complexity to the automation process. This new solution involves designing and implementing a collaborative tool specifically created to cultivate a patina finish on shoe surfaces. The system aims to speed up the process without compromising the quality of the finished product. In order to accomplish this task, a collaborative robot that can regulate contact force and a preexisting software feature for recording manual paths are utilized together with the skills of an expert craftsman. This enables the robot’s end effector to conform to the curved contours of the shoe. Furthermore, the tool’s path and position are modified based on the data from the CAD model to ensure precise outcomes.

Embracing a DT framework can enable the visualization of interdependencies within civil systems, facilitating the prediction of interventions to mitigate future climate change impacts. Therefore, the scope of this review was to determine how UM results are represented to end users, such as architects, and engineers and evaluate if these methods align with industry practices. Initially, we analyzed 70 UM studies to investigate the methods and visualization techniques employed. Trends revealed minimal integration of UM with Industry 4.0 technologies or DTs. The findings underscored a lack of dynamic and geographically oriented visualization in UM, with static representation methods like bar charts and Sankey diagrams prevailing, and mostly disconnected from the geographical location of the flows represented. Consequently, the research was further expanded to explicitly review the use of emerging technologies from Industry 4.0, including DTs, using targeted words. An extended review showed a gap in the integration of the UM framework with DT technologies, although an increased use in mapping was depicted. There was inconsistency in the adoption of specific technologies or visualization methods, highlighting ongoing research in this area. The increased use of geographic information system (GIS) and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) marked a pivotal change for more elaborate mapping of UM outcomes. Limited application of dynamic visualizations in UM persists, with MFA diagrams, Sankey diagrams, and bar charts being commonly used methods, despite the need to develop such type of visualizations in the sustainability field. There is an obvious lack of interoperability of these methods with Computer-Aided Design (CAD) software as well as Building Information Model (BIM) software, which are standard tools in urban planning and design. This limitation is particularly significant in environments where the ability to modify planning scenarios and work with precise spatial representations is crucial. We argue that UM can be more effective if integrated with technologies such as DT, which can resolve the spatial issue and describe UM contextualizing it and potentially depicting it in real-time. Additionally, DTs can offer promising solution by integrating UM analysis results and facilitating modifications to the 3-dimensional environment based on this information. This capability empowers planners and designers to conduct simulations, update UM analyses, and iterate the design process, aligning with contemporary practices in planning and design. Given the interdisciplinary nature of UM, which includes various concepts such as urban flows, city flows, system of systems, and urban networks, our study deliberately focuses solely on UM and its associated frameworks. This targeted approach may limit the breadth of concepts explored, but it ensures depth and coherence in our analysis of UM for this study. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd",Digital twin; Sustainable development; Urban metabolism; Visualization,Architectural design; Climate change; Computer aided analysis; Computer aided design; Computer aided instruction; Geographic information systems; Industry 4.0; Information systems; Information theory; Information use; Integration; Mapping; Optical radar; Sustainable development; Urban growth; Bar chart; City scale; Climate change impact; End-users; Future climate; Industry practices; Planning and design; Sankey diagram; Sustainable urban development; Urban metabolisms; computer aided design; future prospect; GIS; industrial development; industrial practice; information and communication technology; interdisciplinary approach; lidar; material flow analysis; software; sustainable development; technological development; technology adoption; urban design; urban development; urban geography; visualization; Visualization,Review,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85191006969

It causes severe pain in the wrist, triggering disturbance during sleep. Different products like splints, braces and gloves are available in the market to alleviate this disease but there was still a need to improve the wearability, comfort and cost of the product. This study was about designing a comfortable and cost-effective wearable system for mild-to-moderate CTS. Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) therapy has been used to reduce the pain in the wrist. Design/methodology/approach: After simulation by using Proteus software (which allowed the researchers to draw and simulate electrical circuits using ISIS, ARES and PCB design tools virtually), the circuit with optimum frequency, i.e. 33 Hz was selected, and the circuit was developed on a printed circuit board (PCB). The developed circuit was integrated successfully into the half glove structure. Findings: The developed product had good thermophysiological comfort and hand properties as compared to the commercially available product of the same kind. In vivo testing (It involves the testing with living subjects like animals, plants or human beings) was performed which resulted in 85% confirmed viability of the product against CTS. A glove with an integrated circuit was developed successfully to accommodate various sizes without any sex specifications in a cost-effective way to mitigate the issue of CTS. Research limitations/implications: Industrial workers, individuals frequently using their hands or those diagnosed with CTS may wish to use this product as therapy. The attention could not be paid to the aesthetic or visual appeal of the developed product. Originality/value: A very comfortable glove with integrated TENS electrodes was developed successfully to accommodate various sizes without any sex specifications in a cost-effective way to mitigate the issues of CTS. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Carpal tunnel; Comfort; Cotton; Knitted fabric; Smart glove; Syndrome,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85134180652

Generative design, with an algorithm that provides multiple options, could be a potential solution. The challenge is creating an intuitive, user-friendly application that optimizes engineers’ time, reducing manual iterations and lead to a good user experience (UX). A method for evaluating the UX is heuristic evaluation, in which heuristics are used to inspect a software product. Objective: Since generative design applications have specific features, generic heuristics may not detect all problems related to UX. This article presents a novel set of 9 heuristics to evaluate UX in generative design applications: UXH-GEDAPP. This set is focused on evaluating both UX attributes and specific features of generative design applications. Method: A formal methodology was used to develop the heuristics, through 7 stages: exploratory, descriptive, correlational, selection, specification, validation, and refinement. We performed 3 iterations and validated UXH-GEDAPP in 2 iterations through: heuristic evaluation, expert judgment, and user test. Since the methodology can be applied iteratively, we validated and refined the set to improve the proposal. Results: The results obtained in the validation stage indicate that UXH-GEDAPP is useful and more effective than generic heuristics when evaluating generative design applications. UXH-GEDAPP allows to detect specific usability/UX problems as well as more severe problems related to generative design applications. Furthermore, evaluators made fewer errors associating the detected problems with the proposed heuristics, compared to generic sets. Conclusion: UXH-GEDAPP is a new set of heuristics that encourages the creation and use of generative design applications with good UX. It can detect usability/UX problems and help correct them, as well as guide the development of new generative design applications for a pleasant and intuitive user experience. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.",Generative design; Heuristic evaluation; Use experience; User experience heuristics,Design; Formal methods; Heuristic methods; Building design; Design applications; Design Methodology; Generative design; Heuristic evaluation; Infrastructure design; Traditional buildings; Use experience; User experience heuristic; Users' experiences; Iterative methods,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85183457449

While previous research analyzed SO posts related to build/release engineering, we are aware of no research that specifically focused on DevOps related discussions. Objective: This paper aims to learn the challenges developers face while using the currently available DevOps tools and techniques along with the organizational challenges in DevOps practices. Method: We conduct an empirical study by applying topic modeling on 174K SO posts that contain DevOps discussions. We then validate and extend the empirical study findings with a survey of 21 professional DevOps practitioners. Results: We find that: (1) There are 23 DevOps topics grouped into four categories: Cloud & CI/CD Tools, Infrastructure as Code, Container & Orchestration, and Quality Assurance. (2) The topic category ‘Cloud & CI/CD Tools’ contains the highest number of topics (10) which cover 48.6% of all questions in our dataset, followed by the category Infrastructure as Code (28.9%). (3) The file management is the most popular topic followed by Jenkins Pipeline, while infrastructural Exception Handling and Jenkins Distributed Architecture are the most difficult topics (with least accepted answers). (4) In the survey, developers mention that it requires hands-on experience before current DevOps tools can be considered easy. They raised the needs for better documentation and learning resources to learn the rapidly changing DevOps tools and techniques. Practitioners also emphasized on the formal training approach by the organizations for DevOps skill development.

One of these tools is the dental articulator, which is used to simulate the movement of the temporomandibular joint, thus allowing for faster and less invasive diagnostic and treatment interventions. Engineering has played a significant role in the development of more precise and efficient orthodontic techniques and tools, such as digital models, 3D printing of dental implants, and the use of different techniques to record dental movements. These advancements have led to greater precision, efficiency, and comfort in dental treatments and have improved patient outcomes. However, obtaining precise dental trajectories remains a challenge due to the limitations of current dental articulators. To address this challenge, a new approach based on 3D modeling and machine learning is proposed to improve the accuracy of dental trajectory prediction. This approach involves modeling a dental articulator using computer-aided design software, parametrizing the model, and obtaining trajectory data based on certain parameters. The data collected will be used to train a machine learning model based on neural networks to predict dental trajectories. This approach has the potential to significantly improve the accuracy of dental trajectory prediction, which could be useful in the planning and execution of dental treatments and the training of dental professionals.

These advanced technologies could enable students to more easily become creators, develop simulations, and utilise multiple representations of real-world or abstract objects by applying their mathematical and modelling skills.

Our review highlights limitations in tools’ functionalities, including a lack of representative data for LCA and underdeveloped circularity indicators. The paper calls for further development of these tools in terms of interoperability aspects, integration of more sources of data for LCA and circularity, and possibilities for a comprehensive evaluation of design choices. Computational plugins offer greater flexibility, while BIM-LCA integrations have the potential to replace dedicated LCA software and spreadsheets.

In the speculative design sessions, participants were presented with design briefs and asked to answer the questions while speculating about their design. Through 8 interviews resulting in 12 hours of recordings, we conducted a thematic analysis looking for salient themes. This process resulted in a codebook with 62 codes, structured around the main entities involved in the machine learning development process: Data, System, Developers, Users, and Stakeholders; as well as 5 themes that aid us in understanding the potential impacts of the template's use. Our analysis indicates that the EMT shows promise for encouraging reflective ethical practice through linguistic approaches that highlight developers' agency over the system and its consequences for users and stakeholders.

The present study aims to determine whether the implementation of novel algorithmic articulator concepts may be an alternative to avoid dynamic interference contacts during the design process of fixed posterior restorations, and to what extent the occlusal morphology of the restoration is affected. Materials and methods: From a chairside CAD database, a total of 50 clinical patient cases documenting 61 planned fixed restorations in the posterior tooth region were selected. Acommon CAD software program was used for the automated knowledge-based design process. When designing the restorations, functional concepts were applied, including the pure static occlusiont,he average articulation, three different articulator settings as a control, and a combination of a broad range of articulation parameters (the full range dynamic articulation). The resulting dynamic contact points were compared both visually and metrically with a monitoring software program. Results: There is a highly significant difference in avoiding dynamic interference contacts when applyintghe full range dynamic articulation compared with the pure static occlusion (P <0.001) and the average articulation (P < 0.001). Furthermore, the superimposition revealed that the surface of the restorations showed nearly no visual morphologic changes after virtually grinding-in the interpenetrating contact points. Conclusion: The full range dynamic articulation can be used for the design of small fixed posterior restorations to avoid most dynamic interference contacts without the need for determining individual parameters for each patient.

However, widespread adoption is impeded by the lack of user-friendly design tools due to the necessity of domain-specific expertise in computer-aided design (CAD) software and the overwhelming level of design freedom afforded by the MEX process. To overcome these barriers and facilitate the democratisation of design (DoD), this article introduces an innovative, generative-based design (GBD) methodology aimed at enabling non-technical users to create functional components independently. The novelty of this methodology lies in its capacity to simplify complex design tasks, making them more accessible to non-designers. The proposed methodology was tested in the design of a load-bearing part, yielding a functional component within two design iterations. A comparative analysis with the conventional CAD-based process revealed that the GBD methodology enables the DoD, reflected in a 68% reduction in design activities and a decrease in design difficulty of 62% in requisite know-how and a 55% in understanding. Through the creation and implementation of this methodology, the article demonstrates a pioneering integration of state-of-the-art techniques of generative design with design repositories enabling effective co-design with non-designers.  © The Author(s), 2023.

In applied disciplines such as fluid power (FP), hands-on lab experiences constitute an essential component for educating future engineers at both the graduate and undergraduate levels. Physical hydraulic trainers have been developed over the years to expose students to applications of modern FP technology. However, there is a notable absence of virtual tools that can provide students with a realistic feeling of assembling, troubleshooting, and operating an actual hydraulic circuit. This paper describes the effort made to develop an original virtual trainer that fulfills these needs. This virtual trainer is designed to replicate existing physical trainers that were recently designed and implemented for FP education but on a virtual platform. The virtual trainer is implemented in Unity3D software, using CAD drawings of the components from the actual trainer, and provides the user with an interactive environment that reproduces all the aspects of a real lab experience. The tool allows the students to learn by mistake, as in typical activities with a physical trainer and includes realistic operating noise. The core part of the virtual trainer is the object-oriented simulation model that is behind every hydraulic component. First successfully used in the Fall of 2020, and subsequently utilized in both Spring and Fall 2021 courses, the simulator represents an alternative for hands-on experiences, and could be a valid option for distance learning students in the future.

Commonly used design diagrams and patterns are also covered in terms of the design ideas behind and their effective use. The book also explores what (software) design thinking is, the role it plays in a design process, and ways to promote it. Despite object orientation being still the center of attention, there is a strong promotion throughout the book that software design should consider all appropriate design paradigms and methodologies. The book is organized in 10 chapters. Chapter 1 is dedicated to an exploration of what software design may be and entail. Next, chapters 2 and 3 are designed to help readers better understand object orientation, and the essentials of object-oriented design. Chapter 4 is then dedicated to the design of methods,while chapters 5, 6, and 8 respectively include topics about the design of objects, modeling with the Unified Modeling Language, and the use of design patterns. Larger software elements are often directly responsible for the formation of software architecture, thus chapter 7 covers four kinds of larger software elements: libraries, components, frameworks, and microservices, and their architectural implications. Chapter 9 finally brings the presentation of software design to an end with a coverage on software architecture focusing on software architectural views. Case studies are important in learning how to design software, hence chapter 10 then gathers some small design case studies that can be used in earlier chapters as appropriate. These case studies can be extended in different ways to provide additional design opportunities. This textbook book is intended for a junior level undergraduate course on software design, yet the depth of the book makes it also appropriate for a design course at beginning graduate level.

Porcelain veneer restorations are minimally invasive restorations which provide esthetic improvement, therefore proper tooth structure preparation is important. A diagnostic mock-up eases the preparation process for the clinician and allows better communication with the patient. With recent technologies, a more convenient production of the mock-up could be feasible. Materials and Methods: After impressions and photographs, the gathered data was digitized for use on a software for the designing of the digital smile design. 10 resin models were printed and 10 silicone indices were fabricated on top, for the fabrication of molded composite resin mock-ups. While 10 PMMA mock-ups were directly milled from the digital design. 20 preoperative resin models were printed for the fitting of each mock-up individually on a model. All fitted mock-ups were then scanned and uploaded onto a comparison software, to be compared to the reference digital smile design. All mock-ups were subjected to linear measurements digitally using the software and physically using a digital caliper. Statistical analysis was carried out to evaluate the accuracy of each group. Results: Volumetric and linear measurements showed higher trueness of the milled mock-ups to the reference digital smile design. Conclusion: The study exhibited a difference between the milled and molded mock-ups, showing the milled mock-ups are of higher accuracy. Within the limitations of this study, the production of CAD/CAM mock-ups decrease the number of errors along the process. © 2023, Ain Shams University, Faculty of Dentistry.

105,RQ1Art105,Çubukçuoğlu C.,"Çubukçuoğlu, Cemre (57190424919)",57190424919,HOPCA: Hospital Layout Design Optimization using Computational Architecture,2023,A+BE Architecture and the Built Environment,3,,,1.0,250.0,249.0,0,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85161430409&partnerID=40&md5=bf548a3edd1e743ee39cec305bffccb4,"Hospital facilities are known to be functionally complex buildings in various ways, namely due to their non-trivial spatial connectivity requirements. There are several typical problems in hospitals that can be attributed to the configuration of the building, namely the inefficient circulation of medical staff, difficult wayfinding for visitors, lengthy and complex procedures, long walking times, and so on. This Ph.D. research aims to investigate the relation between the performance of hospital buildings focusing on their configurational layout at various levels of abstraction, and to develop a computational design methodology for configurational layout optimization of hospital buildings. To this end, spatial layout methods were devised and tested by using Computational Design techniques derived from the fields of Graph Theory, Operations Research, and Computational Intelligence. The presented research was carried out based on the actions performed in three main parts: Literature Review, Preliminary Research, and Method Development with Case Studies. Firstly, a worldwide literature review was conducted on “configurational layout in general” and “hospital layout” studies to highlight the correspondence between configurational layout methods and hospital layout problems in the current literature. Secondly, preliminary research was conducted on configurational design requirements to identify a typical program of requirements (PoR) and spatial connectivity, adjacency, and closeness requirements of hospitals (REL-Chart), for which expertise knowledge, on-site observations, hospital design codes, and standards were utilized. In addition, international hospital design guidelines were reviewed and a discrete event simulation method that can model the patient flows was developed and programmed as a design toolkit to define the space requirements in CAD software by considering the patient waiting times. The last part is Method Development & Case Studies, in which two parallel tracks of work were reported on “Reconfiguration of existing hospitals” and “Designing hospitals from scratch”. The core concept of the reconfiguration track is assigning hospital units to the existing locations such that the assignment cost (flows of people distances) is minimized. The core concept of designing from scratch is based on a holistic approach consisting of stacking, zoning, and routing. In stacking, a spectral clustering method was proposed for defining the levels of hospital units. In the stage of zoning, hospital units were assigned to the faces of a mesh-surface representation of the floorspace such that the closeness of the interrelated spaces is minimized subject to various constraints. In routing, the corridors were designed by assigning circulation routes to the edges of a mesh-surface representation of the available floor space considering wayfinding and work-related interruptions. Due to the nature of the problems, in the first track for redesigning existing hospitals, Quadratic Assignment Problem (QAP) formulation with geodesic distances and a heuristic optimization algorithm were proposed. In the second track for designing new hospitals, Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) formulations were suggested. The two models have been programmed as a computational design toolkit that is available in popular CAD software in architecture using C# and Python programming languages. The models are not case-based; but for the test and validation of the layout results, each of the models was applied to a real-world case study hospital in Izmir, Turkey. The models were created considering Turkey's hospital design codes and standards and specific to mid-size general hospitals, however, the models can be modified later according to the different regulations of other countries. Effectively, this project presents an interdisciplinary methodological framework that can tackle hospital layout design problems by integrating Computational Design workflows, Graph Theory techniques, Operations Research, and Computational Intelligence into the field of Architectural Space Planning. © 2023 TU Delft.

This study presents the procedure for developing a Heritage Building Information Modeling (HBIM) model, specifically for the Campus of Mimar Sinan University of Fine Arts located in Istanbul - Findikli. This site was originally constructed in the 19th century as twin palaces for (Münire Sultan) and (Cemile Sultan). The paper provides a thorough explanation of the steps involved in acquiring data, generating a point cloud, and carrying out the subsequent stages of 3D modeling, resulting in the development of the HBIM model. Using data derived from digital photogrammetry and applying (Scan to BIM) approach, an HBIM model of the University Campus buildings was constructed. In addition, preexisting building survey drawings were employed to accurately represent the interior features of the building using (CAD to BIM) approach. Reality Capture software was utilized to transform images from a handheld camera and drone into a dense, colored point cloud. Subsequently, Autodesk Recap Pro was used to process this point cloud and to export it to Autodesk Revit. The integration facilitated the merging of point cloud and CAD plan data to create the HBIM model. The resulting parametric HBIM model allows documentation, sharing, and enhancement of extensive information important to architectural heritage. The study utilized photogrammetry as a methodology for data gathering, ensuring a high level of precision in surveys while also being more cost-effective than 3D laser scanning. Consequently, this study presents an economical and replicable approach suited for students and researchers facing constraints such as the unavailability of 3D laser scanning tools or budgetary constraints.  © 2023 IEEE.",3D modelling; 3D survey; architectural documentation; Cultural Heritage; HBIM; heritage conservation; Photogrammetry,Architectural design; Budget control; Computer aided design; Cost effectiveness; Digital storage; Historic preservation; Information management; Laser applications; Photogrammetry; Three dimensional computer graphics; 3D models; 3D survey; 3d-modeling; Architectural documentation; Building Information Modelling; Cultural heritages; Heritage building information modeling; Heritage buildings; Heritage conservation; Point-clouds; 3D modeling,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85189360987

Students value the use of both software and the learning material provided.

Examples of a description of the software dependency configuration based on a semantic versioning system are given. A technique to control the dependences of the components of the distributed information systems is considered. A technique for constructing mathematical support for the nonstationary states of nonlinear electronic circuits by the methods of diakoptics is described. It is noted that the absence of inductive connections between individual subcircuits, as well as the placement of control and controlled variables of each dependent source within each subcircuit, is a necessary condition for the possibility of using the proposed technique. It is shown that the practical implementation of the proposed methodology can significantly increase the productivity of the CAD circuit and solve a calculation problem faster, which is especially important in the development of distributed automation systems for designing a circuit. © 2023, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.",circuit design automation; circuit modeling; decomposition methods; dependences; diakoptics; distributed systems; generalized signal graph; microservice architecture; package manager,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85152428256

Thus, it is necessary to have a means to experimentally downsize controlled conditions of airflow that is geometrically and aerodynamically similar to a real life condition. This can be accomplished using a wind tunnel. In this case, Don Bosco University (UDB) in El Salvador has taken the development and promotion of STEM careers and educational innovation in aerospace Engineering and Technology advancements through the design of a low-speed subsonic wind tunnel (LSWT). Due to the costs and simplicity of manufacturing, a simpler yet effective linear or Eiffel- type design was envisioned for experimentation by students and researchers. To design the geometry of a wind tunnel with specifications of a Mach number of M=0.21-0.22, new methodologies were used including: iterative methodology of parameterized geometry-specified, user-controller parameters in SolidWorks® CAD software for the initial drawings and general layout, a flow analysis of power required according to the pressure losses. Therefore, this document presents the results of a computational methodology developed in Microsoft Office 365 Excel® to iterate the different geometric parameters of each section of the LSWT according to previous studies and numerical and quantitative analyses to determine a general loss coefficient, which can later be used to select am appropriate axial fan that meets the requirements defined by the designer to achieve flow conditions in the test section. According to the iterative analyzes carried out, the section of the tunnel that experiences the greatest loss coefficient and adverse pressure is the main diffuser with a selected length of 5.0 m according to the most efficient energy ratio vs. manufacturing cost-balance. The test section has a double-symmetrical square shape cross section with a height and width of 0.60 m. At the end of the analysis, a tunnel with length of 10.80m was obtained, with a total loss coefficient of 0.158668 and a required flow power of 18.62HP for the desired conditions and a selected 50HP axial fan.  © 2023 IEEE.",Aerodynamics; Axial Fan; Boundary Layer; Losses; LSWT; Mach Number; Reynolds Number; Wind Tunnel,Boundary layers; Computer aided design; Conceptual design; Geometry; Iterative methods; Mach number; Reynolds number; Timing circuits; Wind tunnels; Axial fans; Initial parameter; Loss coefficients; Low-speed wind tunnel; Open-circuits; Power; Reynold number; Section loss; Subsonics; Test sections; Aerodynamics,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85193268997

Many software and hardware platforms have been developed to automate, optimize and algorithmically perform each step of the DBTL cycle. However, there are many fewer options for automating the build step. Build typically involves deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) assembly, which remains manual, low throughput and unreliable in most cases and limits our ability to advance the science and engineering of biology. Here, we present AssemblyTron, an open-source Python package to integrate j5 DNA assembly design software outputs with build implementation in Opentrons liquid handling robotics with minimal human intervention. We demonstrate the versatility of AssemblyTron through several scarless, multipart DNA assemblies, beginning from fragment amplification. We show that AssemblyTron can perform polymerase chain reactions across a range of fragment lengths and annealing temperatures by using an optimal annealing temperature gradient calculation algorithm. We then demonstrate that AssemblyTron can perform Golden Gate and homology-dependent in vivo assemblies (IVAs) with comparable fidelity to manual assemblies by simultaneously building four four-fragment assemblies of chromoprotein reporter expression plasmids. Finally, we used AssemblyTron to perform site-directed mutagenesis reactions via homology-dependent IVA also achieving comparable fidelity to manual assemblies as assessed by sequencing. AssemblyTron can reduce the time, training, costs and wastes associated with synthetic biology, which, along with open-source and affordable automation, will further foster the accessibility of synthetic biology and accelerate biological research and engineering.  © 2023 The Author(s).

The unified modelling language (UML) is one of the most used model languages for applying the MDSE approach. UML has 14 diagram types that describe different perspectives of a software system under development. These diagrams are strongly dependent on each other and must be consistent with one another. The main objectives of this paper are as follows: (1) to understand (i) how aware experts are of model consistency issues and (ii) how relevant these issues are to experts, in order to understand model consistency in the MDSE/UML contexts, and more importantly, (2) to validate a set of 116 UML consistency rules that was systematically collected from the literature, so as to identify the rules that should always be enforced. We conducted a personal opinion survey with 106 experts in SE and MDSE, by means of an online questionnaire. The survey results describe an overview of how the topic of MDSE/UML consistency is handled by experts in the field. In addition, this survey identified a set of 52 UML consistency rules which should always be checked in every UML diagram. The majority of these 52 rules were understood by the majority of respondents and are general-purpose rules that are involved in the Design software development phase. This subset of 52 rules could be considered to be (1) added to the UML standard, (2) used as a reference to researchers who study UML/MDSE, and (3) used as a practical example for teaching purposes. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Empirical study; MDSE consistency; Model-driven software engineering; Personal opinion survey; UML consistency rules; Unified modelling language,Computer software; Software design; Surveys; Empirical studies; Expert opinion; Model consistency; Model-driven software engineering consistency; Model-driven software engineerings; Opinion surveys; Personal opinion survey; Software engineering model; Unified modeling language consistency rule; Unified Modeling Language,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85128744172

On the basis of these generalized architecture frameworks, the architecture of industrial systems such as Reference Architecture Model Industry 4.0 (RAMI4.0), the Industrial Internet of Things Reference Architecture, and Smart Manufacturing Ecosystem has also been established and applied. On the other hand, along with the in-depth research and extensive application of model-based system engineering (MBSE), the framework methodology and design tools such as Harmony, Magic Grid are also changing the traditional pattern of industrial design. In order to solve the problem of adaptation, integration and interoperability of different architecture frameworks as well as their methods and tools in engineering applications, it is necessary to develop a general architecture and modeling framework to support systems, software and enterprises engineering based on different architectures, methods and tools to achieve internal and external integration and interoperability. In this paper, we first propose a general architecture framework (GAF) and its related general modeling framework (GMF). GAF provides MBSE tools and methods for system analysis, design and development. GMF provides a set of models and methods to describe different views of systems. In order to illustrate the common characteristics of GAF and GMF, this paper also discusses the interoperability between GAF, GMF and mainstream architectures and modeling frameworks in detail. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Architecture; Integration; Interoperability; Modelling,Application programs; Industrial research; Integration; Product design; Architecture frameworks; Engineering tools; Enterprise engineering; Framework models; General architectures; General model; Model-based system engineerings; Modeling; Modelling framework; Reference architecture; Interoperability,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85171197866

In the studies evaluating these effects, a few have assessed the impact on software engineering activities from a broader perspective and after a period of time when teams had time to adjust to the changes. No studies have been found comparing software startups and established companies either. This paper aims to investigate the impacts of COVID-19 on software development activities after one year of the pandemic restrictions, comparing the results between startups and established companies. Our approach was to design a cross-sectional survey and distribute it online among software development companies worldwide. The participants were asked about their perception of COVID-19's pandemic impact on different software engineering activities: requirements engineering, software architecture, user experience design, software implementation, and software quality assurance. The survey received 170 valid answers from 29 countries, and for all the software engineering activities, we found that most respondents did not observe a significant impact. The results also showed that software startups and established companies were affected differently since, in some activities, we found a negative impact in the former and a positive impact in the latter. Regarding the time spent on each software engineering activity, most of the answers reported no change, but on those that did, the result points to an increase in time. Thus, we cannot find any relation between the change in time of effort and the reported positive or negative impact.  © 2013 IEEE.",COVID-19; design; international study; pandemic programming; remote work; requirements; software development; software startups; survey; testing; work from home,Computer software selection and evaluation; Quality assurance; Requirements engineering; Software design; Software testing; Engineering activities; International studies; Pandemic; Pandemic programming; Remote work; Requirement; Software development teams; Software startup; Teleworking; Work from home; COVID-19,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85161033909

Therefore, the present study was conducted to examine the structural strength of the banana pseudo-stem fiber-extracting raspador using finite element analysis. For measuring the force required to extract the fibers, a measuring setup along with an embedded system was developed using the ATmega328P microcontroller, DYMH-103 load cell, and 24-Bit ATD converter, and it was found that an average of 99.09 N force was required to scratch the fibers from single pseudo-stem sheath. Three computer-aided design (CAD) models of raspador having tip angles of blades of 25°, 35°, and 45° were developed in the Creo-Parametric software and simulated in the Ansys® software using three material properties, i.e. high-carbon steel, medium-carbon steel, and low-carbon steel. The results of both static structural analysis and explicit dynamics simulation analysis suggested that the CAD model with 45° tip angle of blade having low-carbon steel has a higher value of total deformation and maximum principal stress and a comparatively lower value of equivalent elastic strain than other models and under the yield limit of the parent material. Hence, it may be used for the development of a prototype of a banana pseudo-stem fiber-extracting machine. © 2023 The Author(s).

The aim of this article is to investigate the risk-transmission path of project management based on BIM in the perspective of complex network, and provide a theoretical basis for construction project management. A general complex network theory is established, and then specific complex network models are developed based on the concept of risk to explore the risk-transmission path in a construction project through BIM. Building Information Modelling (BIM) is a set of computer-aided software tools and methods for building design and documentation based on a digital representation of all building components, materials and structure generated from 3D-CAD data. Process models, defined by business analysts, provide a structure for keeping project control. However, some processes are very complex and difficult to model based on classical modeling techniques, like CABS (Constructive Architecture Based on Boundary Value Problem) or DDOE (Distributed Dynamics of Order Execution). To minimize differences between real project construction areas and modeled areas, we need more comprehensive models that represent the dynamic interactions between design and construction phases from the entire project development process rather than only one phase. © 2023 ThinkBiotech LLC.

These techniques will eventually supplant the current VLSI design concept. Design creation has been automated by substituting time-consuming traditional concepts developed by experts. This development could result in a tremendous change in the realm of hardware computation and AI’s powerful analysis tools. As a result, during the last four decades, several tasks have been computerized, and a plethora of sophisticated tasks have been mechanized. And then if someone has invented a new concept (in terms of computing, analyzing, optimization, and inter-relationship manufacturing) and the invention process is computerized, major firms like IBM and Intel have their own CAD division to handle these issues for design automation. Several firms, including major electronic design automation company, sell CAD software’s based on the employment of intelligent tools at circuit development. ML had broadened the present reach by assisting with plausible solutions for an extensive kind on the subject problems as well as challenges in a different range of technical domains. Importance of machine learning in the EDA solutions industry has increased its capabilities by lowering the man-hours spent on design confirmation and its implementation, cost reductions, and design product productivity.

While taking into account area constraints, designers must decide which parts of an application to accelerate in hardware and which to leave in software. Moreover, applications in domains such as Extended Reality (XR) offer opportunities for various forms of parallel execution, including loop level, task level, and pipeline parallelism. To assist the design process and expose every possible level of parallelism, we present Trireme, a fully automated tool-chain that explores multiple levels of parallelism and produces domain-specific accelerator designs and configurations that maximize performance, given an area budget. FPGA SoCs were used as target platforms, and Catapult HLS [7] was used to synthesize RTL using a commercial 12 nm FinFET technology.

The telescope achieved resolving power superior to refractive and reflective optics and produced clear images of the surface of the Moon2. Though metalenses are a promising advance in scaling down the size of optical systems, there are challenges, both in their design and preparing them for high volume manufacturing.

Commissioning activities occur after the design of a new manufacturing system or product line, but before the system is built and deployed into production. Current commissioning practices involve virtual commissioning (VC) tools with limited verification abilities, where virtual models representing a manufacturing system are built and then used in simulation. Software-In-The-Loop (SIL) simulation is applied to virtual models to measure and verify performance metrics that are important to a manufacturer. Due to inaccuracies and gaps in current VC capabilities, physical commissioning is still a common practice for complete verification and validation of a manufacturing system prior to deployment. The need for physical commissioning requires valuable time during the commissioning process. A Full Stack Virtual Commissioning process would eliminate the need for physical commissioning, allowing system integrators to more rapidly commission new manufacturing systems. In this work, we provide an initial Requirements Framework that outlines the critical technological and research gaps that must be addressed in order to achieve a transition toward a Full Stack Virtual Commissioning process. The current state-of-the-art approaches for commissioning are presented, along with an introduction to digital twin technology as an important VC enabler that is being explored within the academic and industrial domains. Lastly we highlight key benefits, important technical gaps, and critical challenges that must be addressed in order to facilitate a transition to Full Stack Virtual Commissioning.

Computer-aided mechanical analysis tools, including multibody dynamics software, are very versatile and have revolutionalized many industries. However, as shown by the literature presented in this review, combining the advantages of multibody system dynamics and machine learning creates new and exciting possibilities. For example, the multibody method can assist machine learning by providing synthetic data, while machine learning can provide fast and accurate subsystem models. The intersection of both approaches results in surrogate and hybrid modeling techniques, advanced control algorithms, and optimal design applications. A notable example is the development of autonomous systems for vehicles, robots, and mobile machinery. In our review we have found nontrivial, innovative, and even surprising applications of machine learning and multibody dynamics. This review focuses on applying neural networks, mainly deep learning, in connection with the multibody system method. Over one hundred and fifty papers are covered, and three main research areas are identified and introduced: data-driven modeling, model-based control and estimation, and data-driven control. The paper starts with a primer on machine learning and concludes with future research directions.

Effectively teaching modelling strategies in traditional classrooms is challenging and the design research community faces barriers in participant recruitment for research studies. In this paper, we propose a framework that connects the teaching and research community with design informatics in CAD. We productized the framework, named the “CAD Challenges” web application, and integrated it to Onshape, a commercially available cloud-CAD software. With free and easy access to this app, users gain access to a library of modelling challenges from within an Onshape document. The app automatically evaluates submissions and provides feedback, enabling asynchronous learning and the development of CAD expertise through practice. After challenge attempts, data on both the design process and the completed model are collected, enabling insight into the different strategies that can be used to create the same geometry. While providing a free and accessible training tool for learners, the big data generated through challenge attempts can provide valuable insight into how students learn CAD and the modeling strategies used by experts. Benefits and opportunities enabled by the framework are discussed in detail with preliminary research analysis.

In dermatology, AI can be used in the form of computer-assisted diagnosis (CAD) systems when assessing and diagnosing skin lesions suspicious of melanoma, a potentially lethal skin cancer with rising incidence all over the world. In particular, CAD may be a valuable tool in the follow-up of patients with high risk of developing melanoma, such as patients with multiple atypical moles. One such CAD system, ATBM Master (FotoFinder), can execute total body dermoscopy (TBD). This process comprises automatically photographing a patient´s entire body and then neatly displaying moles on a computer screen, grouped according to their clinical relevance. Proprietary FotoFinder algorithms underlie this organized presentation of moles. In addition, ATBM Master’s optional convoluted neural network (CNN)-based Moleanalyzer Pro software can be used to further assess moles and estimate their probability of malignancy. Objective: Few qualitative studies have been conducted on the implementation of AI-supported procedures in dermatology. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to investigate how health care providers experience the use and implementation of a CAD system like ATBM Master, in particular its TBD module. In this way, the study aimed to elucidate potential barriers to the application of such new technology. Methods: We conducted a thematic analysis based on 2 focus group interviews with 14 doctors and nurses regularly working in an outpatient pigmented lesions clinic. Results: Surprisingly, the study revealed that only 3 participants had actual experience using the TBD module. Even so, all participants were able to provide many notions and anticipations about its use, resulting in 3 major themes emerging from the interviews. First, several organizational matters were revealed to be a barrier to consistent use of the ATBM Master’s TBD module, namely lack of guidance, time pressure, and insufficient training. Second, the study found that the perceived benefits of TBD were the ability to objectively detect and monitor subtle lesion changes and unbiasedness of the procedure. Imprecise identification of moles, inability to photograph certain areas, and substandard technical aspects were the perceived weaknesses. Lastly, the study found that clinicians were open to use AI-powered technology and that the TBD module was considered a supplementary tool to aid the medical staff, rather than a replacement of the clinician. Conclusions: Demonstrated by how few of the participants had actual experience with the TBD module, this study showed that implementation of new technology does not occur automatically. It highlights the importance of having a strategy for implementation to ensure the optimized application of CAD tools.

The technological advancements in the design and control of off-road electric vehicles have required the development of high-fidelity models to predict vehicle dynamic responses. High-fidelity modelling in off-road mobility is important for several reasons, including accurate prediction of the vehicle performance prior to road tests, optimization of energy management, and identification of failure modes. In this paper, a high-fidelity vehicle dynamics model is developed for a 4-wheel independent drive/steer scaled electric off-road vehicle using the MapleSim™ software package. The vehicle multibody dynamic model consists of all the mechanical subsystems of the vehicle, including: a) double wishbone suspension, b) independent steering mechanisms, c) independently driven powertrain, and d) the chassis. Experimental parameter identification is performed to identify the parameters of some key subsystems of the vehicle model. Vehicle mechanical subsystem parameters such as the a) vehicle drag frontal area, b) wheel inertia, and c) location of the vehicle centre of gravity are determined. The accuracy of the multibody dynamic model for an off-road electric vehicle heavily depends on the accuracy of the coupled electrical subsystem model. Therefore, to incorporate the electrical subsystem into the system model, the developed vehicle dynamics plant model is imported into MATLAB™/SIMULINK™ using the Functional Mock-up Interface and an electrical model of the Brushless DC inverter subsystem is developed using custom SPICE based libraries. This co-simulation approach allows electro-mechanical models to be developed from a design-first perspective using electrical and mechanical computer-aided design tools. This leads to a streamlined path for the designer to validate decisions prior to fabrication and assembly. © 2023 IEEE.",Automotive Control; Co-simulation; Cyber-Physical Modeling; Parameter Identification; Vehicle Dynamics,Computer aided design; Dynamic models; Dynamics; Electric inverters; Electric vehicles; Landforms; Off road vehicles; Parameter estimation; Vehicle performance; Automotive control; Cosimulation; Cybe-physical modeling; Cyber physicals; High-fidelity modeling; Mechanical subsystems; Multibody dynamics model; Parameters identification; Physical modelling; Vehicle's dynamics; Roads and streets,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85164111079

Various software systems are available on the market, on the one hand with embedded CAD systems and on the other hand with stand-alone systems. A major challenge in secondary and tertiary education is to combine virtual engineering methods with general engineering knowledge. This results in the quality issue of teaching how to use the software and teaching the generally applicable knowledge behind the software solutions - i.e., the methods must be taught. At Austrian HTL (secondary higher vocational schools), there is a strong focus on CAD during five years of education. In recent years, some aspects of virtual engineering have been taken up to prepare students well for working life. However, it is widely recognised that this needs to be strengthened. The paper will present the current state-of-the-art and show possible scenarios for improving the current state. At the Graz University of Technology (tertiary level), there is the situation that students have very different prior knowledge at the beginning of their studies (mainly mechanical engineering), as some of them come from HTL. An e-learning approach for CAD and CAE education was introduced in 2012 at TU Graz to counteract this and better adapt the teaching to the student's skills. As a result, a lot of experience and feedback have been gathered to improve the teaching approach continuously. The article shows this approach and outlines future perspectives. © 2023 Proceedings of the 25th International Conference on Engineering and Product Design Education: Responsible Innovation for Global Co-Habitation, E and PDE 2023.

Cultivated meat is a rapidly advancing technology that produces meat products by proliferating and differentiating animal stem cells in large bioreactors, avoiding conventional live-animal farming. While many companies are working in this area, there is a lack of existing infrastructure and experience at commercial scale, resulting in many technical bottlenecks such as scale-up of cell culture and media availability and costs. In this study, we evaluate theoretical cultivated beef production facilities with the goal of envisioning an industry with multiple facilities to produce in total 100,000,000 kg of cultured beef per year or ~0.14% of the annual global beef production. Using the computer-aided process design software, SuperPro Designer®, facilities are modeled to create a comprehensive analysis to highlight improvements that can lower the cost of such a production system and allow cultivated meat products to be competitive. Three facility scenarios are presented with different sized production reactors; ~42,000 L stirred tank bioreactor (STR) with a base case cost of goods sold (COGS) of $35/kg, ~211,000 L STR with a COGS of $25/kg, and ~262,000 L airlift reactor (ALR) with a COGS of $17/kg.

The gripper has been designed using advanced Computer-Aided Design (CAD) software to be easily fabricated using additive manufacturing techniques. The solution involved the use of a lumped compliant element to obtain the desired constant force output, resulting in a gripper that is easily maintainable and cost-effective. The use of a constant force mechanism eliminates the need for dedicated sensors and complex control algorithms to avoid object damage, as completely closing the grasp is sufficient for every operation. The optimization of the compliant element shape has been crucial for achieving the desired constant force output and has required a Matlab software optimization framework using the pseudo-rigid body model equations and an fmincon algorithm. The virtual prototyping approach, using a flexible multi-body dynamics software, has enabled fast and easy testing of the CAD design, leading to an optimized final design with high performance and precision. The study results have demonstrated the potential of virtual prototyping for the design and optimization of advanced robotic systems in cost-sensitive industries, particularly in the food harvesting sector.

The implementation of established craft practices in modern sustainable mass production requires the development and application of software and hardware computer tools as well as production machinery. Although the management of textile waste for interior design articles is addressed in the scientific literature by various techniques, there is still limited data and strategies based on the use of specific algorithms. Therefore, in this research, an algorithm is proposed, with the help of which textile waste resulting from upholstery production can be reused in the creation of interior decoration parts. The algorithm is implemented in the GNU Octave 6.4 programming environment, which makes it easily redistributable and accessible. The algorithm consists of a total of six stages, offering an option for arranging the textile elements and analyzing their color characteristics. The arrangement is performed with a Voronoi diagram, and the colors are represented by a four-color circle. Moreover, data on waste textile fabrics are presented, as well as their application in the conception of interior design elements. The proposed algorithm allows designers to focus on the visual design rather than compatibility checks and constraints. The present paper provides an algorithm for reusing textile wastes, which come in a variety of shapes and colors and are produced throughout the fabric cutting phase of upholstery manufacturing, in order to identify the most optimal combinations in matching irregular waste shapes and combinations of colors, create a suitable pattern for new interior design items, and contribute to improving the sustainable management of textile waste that is produced in considerable amounts. © 2023 by the authors.",algorithm; circular economy; craft; design tools; fabrication; sustainability; textile waste,algorithm; industrial waste; manufacturing; recycling; sustainability; textile industry; waste management,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85166509003

To ensure operability, these adjustments have to be carried out in some cases even after the data freeze of a development phase. Since these changes may also be relevant for subsequent development phases, redundant design efforts are the consequence. One way to increase the efficiency of these processes is to reuse knowledge. This paper reviews the state of the art of knowledge reuse in engineering design and in software development. Furthermore, an overview of the structure of a wiring harness, as well as the knowledge contained in the corresponding CAD data is presented. Thereupon, all scenarios are specified in which knowledge reuse in the wiring harness development could be possible. Subsequently, a methodology for complete, partial and assisted reuse is specified enabling the transfer of gained knowledge into other CAD data sets of wiring harnesses.

The intensive research within this area has been stimulated by the development of efficient methods and algorithms on one side and the needs and demands of contemporary engineering on the other. Over the years, the practical aspect of topology optimization has become one of the most significant issues within the design community. Simultaneously, the range of design applications has been broadening. Among many research areas where topology optimization is present, attention has been paid to the design of multi-material structures. The gradation of the material properties has a significant influence on the final layout of the structure, so this problem can be treated as an extension of the classical task of the topology optimization of structures made of a material with uniform distributions of properties. While working with multi-material structures, the important role plays an interface between parts made of materials with different properties. In this paper, the implementation of interfaces made of functionally graded materials (FGM) is proposed. A functionally graded interface means that continuous and smooth changes of properties are assigned to a particular direction from one material surface to another. This paper presents the idea of topology optimization of graded multi-material structures using a simple, fast convergent technique based on the Cellular Automata approach. The proposal is to take the advantage of the versatility of efficient professional finite element-based structural analysis software and the simplicity of the original heuristic topology generator, to build a tool for the optimization of FGM structures as well as multi-material structures including the FGM interface. © 2023 by the authors.",Cellular Automata; compliance minimization; functionally graded materials; heuristic methods; multi-material structures; topology optimization,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85149977562

This type of problem is reduced by combining BIM drawings prepared by designers and making them into a single model.

Nevertheless, the global competition has increased the challenges in terms of prices, shorter lifecycle, more customized demand, complex products, the entrance of more suppliers, and strict government regulations; at present, these all have increased the numerous obstacles to manufacturers. Therefore, Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) has become a vital tool in getting a competitive advantage by creating and providing better quality products at less time and competitive price, sustainably achieving a compelling cost advantage. PLM supports the management to control the portfolio of the products and services, processes from the beginning of the concept, product designing, engineering, production, launch, and uses to disposal of the product. To cope with the global competition, organizations have to amalgamate PLM with technology such as Computer-Aided Design (CAD), Manufacturing Process Management (MPM), Computer-Aided Manufacturing (CAM), and Product Data Management (PDM); this systematic way helps in enabling the online sharing of product data as well as business applications. This coordinates and unifies the products, services, processes, and project data across the entire lifecycle among numerous external and internal players of an organization. This chapter discusses various aspects of the PLM, its process and workflows, PLM strategy and implementations, process modelling, modelling using UML, system architecture, Product data throughout the product lifecycle, Model-based systems engineering, and systems description techniques. These models help get insights about the application of PLM in the manufacturing industry and help PLM apply its concepts systematically for managing the product-related information and processes across the value chain of a product. Such as Unified Modelling Language (UML) is a graphical modelling language used for specialized graphical presentation of business and system software; Product Data Management (PDM) directly deals with the centralizing data of a product; System Architecture is an abstract, global, conceptualized, and focused process in achieving the lifecycle concepts and mission of the system etc. PLM in the manufacturing industry connects the manufacturers and their stakeholders in a digital cloud-based environment; as a result, the manufacturer can run production much faster to meet customer demand timely. © 2023 Scrivener Publishing LLC.",Architecture; Modelling; Planning; Process; Product; Product lifecycle management (PLM); Strategies; Unified modelling language (UML),,Book chapter,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85162614847

Due to such a significant lack and the emergence of innovative technologies for creating digital models of buildings and constructions, the problem of developing an approach to the formation of projects for various engineering systems in the BIM environment (Building Information Model or Modeling) becomes relevant. This environment, previously used to develop predominantly architectural and constructive solutions, now allows creating digital twins of various elements for technical systems in the volume necessary for construction and operation. Due to the fact that these elements are equally detailed both geometrically and parametrically (the object is not a conditional geometric primitive, but is endowed with all the necessary physical properties appropriate to a real element), it is possible to form a full-fledged digital model of the engineering system for a building or construction by actions aimed at creating relationships between digital elements according to a certain principle. The most popular software for developing design solutions within the framework of BIM technologies is currently Revit software from Autodesk, which is the developer of the world's most popular CAD solution -AutoCad.

They are labelled Generative Engineering, Generative Design, Algorithm Based Design, Simulation Based Design or similar. Those new tools have in common that they make intensive use of Artificial Intelligence methods and extensive computing power. The focus of these algorithm-driven approaches to developing products and finding solutions is not the explicit creation of geometry but rather the definition of constraints, boundary conditions, rules and procedures that allow the computation of feasible solutions including the implicit generation of geometric models. One major idea is to initially open up wide solution spaces that are goal-oriented based on given requirements and provide engineers with all relevant information to perform trade-off studies and create new and innovative solutions instead of perpetuating existing solutions. The new tools are often associated with topology optimization and generative manufacturing, but the concepts go far beyond and lead to a complete workflow in the creation of products. The paper systematically analyses different software tools and shows that Generative Design and Engineering is interpreted and implemented differently by various software vendors, all pursuing different goals. In addition to the potentials, the paper mainly shows the current limitations of the implemented approaches in the different CAD tools.

Among the mechanical movements of equipment, linear movement is one of the most common and important. In this paper, a simplified position measurement system using Tunneling Magneto-Resistance (TMR) sensing technique is proposed to cater this objective.

Among many magnetic sensing technologies, magnetoresistive sensors have higher sensitivity and stability, smaller energy consumption and volume, and shorter response time. Among the magnetoresistive sensing technologies, tunneling magnetoresistance effect sensors have the best performance.

This tool could then also be used to investigate load transfer to other subsea structures and facilities. A numerical modeling procedure is developed using the finite element analysis software Abaqus where the large deformation process of iceberg-pipe-soil interaction can be accommodated using the Coupled Eulerian Lagrangian (CEL) technique. The complexity of the ice-pipe-soil interaction is captured by appropriate and varied contact strategies in different areas of the model. Details of the model are discussed, including advancements of soil behavior and flexible flowline mechanical response, where it is desirable for the design tool to be optimized for computational efficiency while retaining reliable predictions of response. Case studies are presented for thick walled pipeline, flexible flowlines and electrical cables. Typically, the ice is modeled as a rigid body with unlimited strength. Limiting ice interaction forces, via pressure, is shown to have an effect on the displaced shape of the pipeline and flexible. Including radial compliance of the electrical cable is also shown to have an effect. With mesh refinement and retaining sufficient complexity in key areas, the complex model can be analyzed with a reasonable amount of computational cost. Advancements in the modeling of the ice feature strength limits are highlighted as well as application of large deformation modeling of electrical cables, which is atypical. © 2023, Offshore Technology Conference.",,ABAQUS; Arctic engineering; Computational efficiency; Flowlines; Offshore oil well production; Offshore technology; Risk assessment; Software testing; Soils; Design tool; Electrical cables; Ice keels; Laboratory testing; Load transfer; Physical testing; Pipe-soil interaction; Sub-sea pipelines; Subsea cables; Subsea structure; Numerical models,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85156130325

Several proposed methods focus exclusively on the environmental impacts of products rather than taking a holistic perspective that includes social and economic sustainability. Despite the advancements in tools for incorporating sustainability in the product design phase, designers are not universally adopting these tools mainly due to their fragmented or underdeveloped characteristics. This research aims to integrate change propagation and sustainable design tools within a holistic framework that can enable simultaneous consideration of design parameters' impacts on the three dimensions of sustainability. A reusable water bottle is used to demonstrate the application of the proposed holistic, sustainable design framework. The interdependencies among these design parameters are captured using a multi-domain matrix (MDM), and then equations are defined to quantify these dependencies. Life cycle assessment (LCA) is then performed in an automated way to evaluate the product's environmental impacts, and the investigation of its results provides details to identify critical unit processes contributing to the environmental categories. Using this framework, sensitivity analyses are able to reveal how changes to individual design parameters propagate through the model to influence the three dimensions of sustainability. © 2023 American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME).

More specifically, the geometry of an existing physical item’s geometry needs to be defined in order to fabricate and seamlessly integrate an additional component. In this instance, a 3D scanning technique was used to digitize an e-bike’s frame geometry. This was essential for creating a peripheral component (in this case, a rear rack) that would be integrated into the frame of the bicycle. In lieu of just developing a tail rack from scratch, a CAD generative design process was chosen in order to produce a design that favored both light weight and optimal mechanical behaviors. FDM 3D printing was utilized to build the final design using ABS-CF10 materials, which, although being a thermoplastic ABS-based material, was introduced as a metal replacement for lighter and more ergonomic component production. Consequently, the component was manufactured in this manner and successfully mounted onto the frame of the e-bike.

Relational database and attributes driven graphics are being used to transform CAD drawing to intelligent drawings. These intelligent drawings and design data is used to make smart decisions. The latest methods to create project digital twin are evolving to make use of these intelligent drawings. This paper discusses the user friendly and innovative solutions to accomplish digital twin goals at EPC stage. P&ID is a valuable data source for oil and gas projects. It is used to generate pipelines, instrumentations and equipment lists. These are mainly used for material take-off and other procurement purposes. In Intelligent P&IDs these lists reporting may be customized and attained, automatically. During digital twin creation process, sharing of data with different departments via direct links and data lake is necessitated. During project EPC stage, data lake may be used to find many out of the box solutions e.g., training AI models to predict project completion dates and material supply-demand issues, proactively. Due to stringent project schedules, it is always challenging to achieve an important milestone of timely issuance of Intelligent P&IDs. Variety of difficulties during development of intelligent P&IDs are summarized below: 1. Drafting of modification and demolition P&IDs for brown-field project 2. Drafting of colour coded system turnover P&IDs 3. Revision & scope clouds Customization to meet digital twin requirements methods in available intelligent software are not user friendly. Many steps are involved to perform above mentioned tasks. Various lists generated from P&IDs such as line list consumes significant time and prone to error if not managed properly. Digital twin requirements make it further complex. Various techniques are used to perform routine drafting of P&IDs, attain required reporting and digital twin targets. However, these need to be managed and customized by highly skilled professionals. There is a need for tailor-made solutions in the intelligent P&ID software to make operations user friendly. Cloud computing big data handling capability and AI may help to meet digital twin requirements. Archiving and retrieving data from ultra-fast cloud facilities may solve many problems. This paper provides ideas to debottleneck various limitations in the currently available drafting software.

However, the previous optimization approaches have already exhausted their potential and possibilities for further improving production, and the 4th industrial revolution has arrived. Digitalization plays the most critical role in the optimization of production today. One of the essential technologies for digitizing production is the digital twin technology. A digital twin is an exact virtual model of a product or production line. It consists of several elements, such as manufacturing simulations, 3D CAD models, and real-time data feeds from sensors embedded in the physical operating environment. The article presents the concept of a digital twin at the Faculty of Manufacturing Technologies of the Technical University of Košice. It describes 3 phases of model creation: CAD software, Unreal Engine, and real-time 3D software (Twinmotion). The research presents a systematic approach to solving the problem of creating a digital twin for education purposes. A prototyped digital twin of the faculty building and facilities can be used for educational and presentation purposes regarding remote learning, enabling students and educators to move around the building remotely. The digital twin, created by using multimedia and immersive technologies, will expand opportunities and increase learning efficiency in various ways, but it will also provide the basis for industrial production to increase productivity and quality. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Computer Modelling; Digital Twin; Remote Learning; Sustainable Manufacturing,E-learning; Education computing; Electronic data interchange; Engineering education; Case-studies; Computer models; Industrial production; Industrial revolutions; Optimisations; Optimization approach; Productline; Remote learning; Sustainable manufacturing; Virtual models; Computer aided design,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85163377949

However, they are often simplified and unrealistic for certain purposes. One major limitation is that manikins tend to be based on average human measurements which can diminish accuracy when assessing interaction. Although many large-scale 3D scanning campaigns have been conducted, the transfer of this information to automotive innovation tools is limited. To date, there is no direct methodology that introduces 3D scans of real people into the design software tools commonly used in the automotive sector. This study presents a novel methodological approach to capturing, processing and generating digital human models for simulation. Relevant contributions include the design of a protocol for scanning people in postures that take autonomous driving use cases into consideration, as well as the development of advanced processing algorithms that solve the presence of occlusions due to the interaction between the body and seat. Finally, we have also created tools to mathematically transform and convert mesh objects into files to render them interoperable within design environments.

Moreover, the octocopter PID controller was simulated on the Simulink environment to get performance on the roll and pitch angle control. Design/methodology/approach: Octocopter is one kind of multirotor vehicle (a rotorcraft with more than two rotors), that has lately gained a lot of attention for both the scientific and commercial spheres. With a greater number of rotors, the multirotor is very maneuverable and robust. Multi-copter makes an important contribution to the technological revolution in the military, industry, transportation, mapping and especially agriculture. Nowadays, we are heading to the four-industrial revolutions as well as the new technological application in the agricultural field such as precision agriculture, mapping and surveillance. Due to recently advanced technology about sensors, electronics, 3D printing, battery with high performance, multi-copter can be manufactured at low cost. Findings: The V-frame octocopter was chosen to design in this paper; it had better performance scores including high redundancy rotors, high payload capability and affordable cost than another multi-copter family. The V-frame octocopter increasing freedom field of view of the camera was considered to place the camera position in the front of the drone. Research limitations/implications: For the future aspects, the mechanical structure of the octocopter could be improved by using more advanced metal 3D printing to produce the aluminum or titan alloy materials for lighter and more rigid compared with ABS material, and finally the assembly to the real test. Originality/value: The study shows the new platform of the V-frame octocopter kinematics analysis, designed on the CAD software, with some important mechanical parts using FEM analysis to find the highest stress and displacement under high load applied, the result of all connecting the joints 3D printing part is completely safe. Mechanical parts were manufactured by using 3D printing technology and CNC milling. Moreover, the study has shown V-frame octocopter simulation based on Simulink using the second method Ziegler- Nichols to find suitable parameters of the PID controller for roll and pitch angle.

However, as digitisation increases, the number of product types and the correspondingly more complex manufacturing processes, neutral data formats are often distorted or even lost when used across systems, leading to design and manufacturing errors. Therefore, there is a need to build a bridge between information interactions so that models can be accurately and efficiently transferred from one computer-aided design system to another. This paper proposes a method for unifying PMI structures by analysing STEP files to establish geometric dimensions and tolerances, annotating and decomposing several types of generic geometric elements into basic dimensional elements and positional information, establishing intuitive model-PMI relationships, and extracting the elements required for the exchange process and storing them in a STEP parser for PMI product information construction between different systems. Through experimental analysis, the method proposed in this paper has been shown to be highly accurate in exchanging information between three different CAD systems, achieving clarity, certainty and consistency at different stages of the product lifecycle.

It is, however, unclear from the state-of-the-art what a consistent and complementary set of models to generate is, how these models can be generated such that relationships and dependencies in a set of related user stories are unveiled, and why these models are useful in agile software development projects. In this paper, we address these questions through a Design Science research study. First, we define four stylized versions of Unified Modeling Language (UML) diagrams (i.e., use case diagram, class diagram, activity diagram, state machine diagram) that will be the target of the model generation. Although these stylized UML diagrams have a reduced abstract syntax, they offer different perspectives on the software system in focus with potential usefulness for requirements and software engineering. Second, we develop an automated model generation approach based on different design artifacts including a Natural Language Processing (NLP) tool that implements our approach. Key to our solution is the use of the Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) scenario template to document user stories. Using an example set of BDD scenarios as source of the model generation, we demonstrate the feasibility of our approach via the NLP tool that implements our approach. Third, we conduct an empirical study with experts in agile software development involving the researcher-guided interactive use of our tool to explore the use of the generated models.

It is necessary to ensure that greenhouse gases are emitted as few as possible, particularly for the development of new products. The most important decisions, with impact on the sustainability, are already made by the product designer during the virtual product development phase, such as raw material requirements, selected manufacturing process or thermal and surface treatments. Especially in the case of ablative processes (CNC), raw material has a major impact on the calculated carbon footprint of products. In order to minimize the emissions of greenhouse gases in the virtual product development phase already, this paper presents an approach to provide assistance for the product designer regarding the ecological impact of his decisions. For this purpose, Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) methods are directly integrated into the CAD software. During the design process, the expected CO2 equivalents of the largest influencing factor - the raw material - can be displayed which is observed for most cases of metal material. In addition, the savings potential for reducing the blank volume or changing the raw material is shown and a suggestion is made. © 2023, The Author(s).",Assistance System; CAD; CAM; Life Cycle Assessment; Multi Scenario Analyzer; Sustainable Product Development,Carbon dioxide; Carbon footprint; Ecodesign; Environmental impact; Greenhouse gases; Life cycle; Product design; Product development; Sustainable development; Assistance system; Greenhouses gas; Life cycle assessment; Manufactured products; Multi scenario analyzer; Multi scenarios; Product designers; Product development phasis; Sustainable product development; Virtual product development; Computer aided design,Conference paper,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85161423917

One of the most complex actions in reverse engineering is the representation of CAD models from point data, as a 3D surface reconstruction requires complex surface fitting algorithms. The evolution of reverse engineering software is in place as most CAD software can’t handle large amounts of point data and need discrete software packages for point processing. Feature-based algorithms are revolutionizing the reverse engineering system from point cloud to complete solid models. This chapter starts with the definition of reverse engineering, followed by why there is a need to reverse engineer products. Afterward, reverse engineering strategy, generic processes associated (with contact and non-contact scanning), point processing, and geometric model development are introduced. The reverse engineering concerning nature is also explained with examples. Later the in-depth description of methodologies and techniques used in reverse engineering are explained.

Courtyards as passive design concept is a sustainable design tool since many ages. Proper courtyards’ ratios integration in school buildings can help in improving the thermal comfort and lighting in the classrooms with less energy consumption especially in the hot arid climates like UAE. This research used a qualitative methodology based on IESve software to evaluate the effect of variation in the proportions of the school courtyards on the thermal performance and lighting of classrooms, the models of the study were built according to Koch-Nielsen assumption courtyards’ ratios for a school building as a case study. The results of this research confirmed that the ratios of closed courtyards affect the thermal performance of the buildings based on investigation rooms. The findings of this research showed that the 2X courtyards width to height ratio succeeded to reduce the inner investigation room’s air temperature with about 4–6 °C compared to 3X and open X Courtyards’ cases. Additionally, the simulation revealed that the investigation rooms in the open X and the 3X courtyards’ cases had the highest daylight and lux levels, which was to be expected given that both cases featured fewer sheltered outside spaces with greater solar exposure than the 2X courtyard. Finally, the 2X courtyard case had the best threshold glare level for the investigation room at roughly 212.48 cd/m2, with significant difference from the other cases.

There is a variety of software design tools, such as Data Flow Diagram (DFD) and Unified Modeling Language (UML), used to depict interactions between systems. However, these tools can be complex and burdensome for system developers, users, and investors who may not fully understand the system's intricacies. Researchers have proposed a prototype software development framework using an Information Flow Diagram (IFD). It is approach simplifies the software design process, reduces the diversity of diagram designs, and yields genuine efficiency. Some educational institutions have already incorporated this new design tool for using Information Flow Diagram (IFD). There are curriculums, especially in software and engineering courses to teach students how to design mobile-based online plant tissue culture distribution learning system media easily, conveniently, and with fewer steps. This helps students grasp software design concepts more readily and enhances productivity for system developers, users, and investors, meeting their requirements clearly.

Such decisions be-come possible when the users may have the right tools at the right time. As there may be different tool preferences among engineers in different problem domains or also organizations working within the same problem domain, the interactions between the people working on a common project can be hindered as they need to agree first on the toolset. Thus, supporting different tools and formats can be a valuable asset in engineering projects. This paper presents an approach for building an interoperable solution to be able to support different engineering tools. The approach is illustrated using a pipe routing application based on genetic algorithm (GA) and A∗ algorithm. The output can be handled by end users in web browser, Siemens NX and AVEVA tools. The solution can also be extended to include other tools. The evaluation of the proposed approach is conducted using a qualitative metric that considers the three dimensions of the system development methodology.

The incidence of coronary artery disease (CAD), the leading cause of mortality in most developed and developing countries, is increasing. The adoption of hospital registries can improve care delivery and facilitate the management of CAD through better planning, as well as help with outcome assessment through more effective data management. Objectives. The present study is aimed at designing a hospital-based CAD registry for managing CAD data. Methods. This developmental study was conducted in three phases. Initially, sources related to CAD registries were reviewed, the results of which were published in two studies. In the next phase, the prerequisites and requisites of the software were determined through a qualitative study. In this phase, the registry dataset was determined by using a questionnaire. Finally, the developed conceptual model of the software was validated. The software was then developed based on the validated conceptual model. Results. The registry data elements were classified into 13 main categories, including identification data, medical history, and risk factors. The dataset included 171 data elements, including data related to surgical and nonsurgical procedures. The conceptual model was approved by field experts, and the software was developed accordingly. Conclusion. The steps followed in the present study for developing the CAD registry can be used as an appropriate approach for designing similar hospital-based registries. Considering the pivotal role of the registry in the management of CAD, the routine and systemic use of the registry is suggested in all healthcare centers.  © 2023 Ali Garavand et al.",,Coronary Artery Disease; Hospitals; Humans; Iran; Registries; Risk Factors; Article; conceptual model; coronary artery disease; disease registry; female; human; information processing; Iran; male; medical history; qualitative research; questionnaire; risk factor; software design; coronary artery disease; hospital; Iran; register,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85147392901

Nevertheless, especially from the satellite on-board software engineering point of view, these technologies require a solid ground to be built upon. First of all, the computational power of the hardware platform must meet the needs of the advanced algorithms running on top of it. The software layer too must both allow an efficient use of the hardware resources and at the same time guarantee non-functional properties such as dependability in compliance with ECSS standards. Finally, the design methods need to adapt to the specific challenges posed by both the increased complexity of the hardware/software and Industry 4.0. The METASAT Horizon Europe Project which started in January 2023 will address these challenges. The METASAT vision is that a design methodology based on model-based engineering jointly with the use of open architecture hardware constitutes that solid ground. To reach its vision, METASAT will leverage existing software virtualisation layers (e.g., hypervisors), that already provide guarantees in terms of standards compliance, on top of high-performance computing platforms based on open hardware architectures. The focus of the project will be on the development of a toolchain to design software modules for this hardware/software layer. Without such measures, the time and cost of developing new systems could become prohibitive as system complexity grows, reducing competitiveness, innovation, and potentially dependability across the industry. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023.",Digital Twin; High-Performance; Hypervisor; Model-Based Design; Modularity; Open Hardware; Reusability; Satellite,Competition; Computer architecture; Design; Industry 4.0; Regulatory compliance; Satellites; Hardware/software; High-performance; Hypervisors; Model based testing; Model-based design; Modular modelling; Modularity; Open hardware; Performance; Space domain; Reusability,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85178655341

The manufacture of these plates requires an accurate cast of the maxilla, and their efficacy relies on their stability and retention. As such, the quality of the impression is a determining factor. The lack of commercially available stock trays for infants with TS21 creates difficulties, including inadequate impression quality and the risk of inhaling impression material. The present technique simplifies impression making for infants with TS21 from 3 months of age to when their maxillary deciduous teeth erupt by using computer-aided design and computer-aided manufacturing (CAD-CAM) impression trays. Sixty-five stored gypsum maxillary casts from infants with TS21 that had been used to manufacture myostimulation plates were analyzed to select four differently sized representative casts for designing the impression trays. A CAD software program was used to digitally shape four sizes of the impression tray from the selected gypsum casts. Practitioners interested in this approach can download and export the standard tessellation language (STL) files using a quick response (QR) code. The impression trays should be manufactured with the stereolithography additive technique using biocompatible resin. This technique allows practitioners to make accurate maxilla impressions for infants with TS21 by manufacturing their own impression trays using the free-access STL files rather than the cumbersome conventional method. © 2023 Editorial Council for The Journal of Prosthetic Dentistry",,,Article,Article in press,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85160287579

In software development, established platforms such as GitHub exist, which have been shown to improve stakeholder communication, requirements elicitation, and software design decisions. In product development, similar platforms exist with impressive functionality, but which have some drawbacks such as closed source licenses, vendor-specific data formats, and expert-level user interfaces. To overcome the current situation, we study how the ideas of GitHub can be translated to an open source solution for product development and which concepts can be reused or must be changed. Core deliverables of our work are (1) an integrated data model of requirements (or design tasks), project schedules, and revisions of computer-aided design (CAD) models as well as (2) an interface model. © The Author(s), 2023.

In automotive industry, since the structure of steering knuckles is very complex and different from each other; it is difficult to design it separately for each vehicle. In order to address this problem, an innovative idea to solve this problem was developed and named as analysis support tool for steering knuckle of the entire vehicle. In addition to that, the development of computer tool that can assist designers in the analysis phase can save the design time. For this purpose, analysis support tool for steering knuckles of entire vehicles has been developed. The part is first modeled by Free CAD 0.2 software considering the precision of the geometry. Based on scientific approach analysis support tool for steering knuckle of all vehicles is developed which can provide analysis of all forces acting on the component, maximum displacement, fatigue damage, maximum deflection, slope, factor of safety, life expectancy, stress and strain amplitude by stress and strain method and compare the results from Morrow, Smith Watson and Walker equations. In addition to that doing experiment of multiaxial is very expensive and time taking for the designer; therefore, developing simple, accurate and robustness tool used to determine life expectancy and cumulative fatigue damage of multiaxial which can be applied to entire materials is very crucial. The developed tool would be universal, effective, simple, and efficient method used to estimate the life expectancy and Cumulative fatigue damage of multiaxial. Finally, data’s from open literatures are used to validate the accuracy and capabilities of the proposed tool for multiaxial fatigue loading. The end result is a computer tool that can be dedicated and run on any computer without using any internet connection. © 2006-2023 Asian Research Publishing Network (ARPN).

This design is very complicated because the ramps affect the excavation’s shape, therefore, its economic value. Thus, planners generate contours to be used as reference for the design. These contours (or equivalently the volume they contain) are generated by mathematical models that aim to optimize the economic value that is contained in them. Then, through Computer-Aided Design software, planners manually draw the operational design that, hopefully, retrieves as much value as possible from the reference volumes and is operationally feasible. Unfortunately, this manual process does not ensure the quality of the design, leading to results that are not optimal and are highly dependent on the engineer’s expertise. This article presents a methodology that starts from the same reference volume that the planner uses to generate a mine design automatically. It works in two steps. Firstly, it uses integer programming to generate a new discretized contour but containing enough space for ramps. Secondly, it utilizes a computer algorithm to transform the discretized profile into an operational pit design that complies with the mine design’s geometrical constraints. To study the proposed methodology’s applicability, we considered three cases with their corresponding reference pushbacks and used our approach to create 15 different operational designs (in total). In two of the three cases, the methodology generated profiles that were, at worst, within less than 2 % deviation in value and tonnage. In the third case, the loss in economic value was more than 11 % ; however, this performance was equivalent to a manual design produced by an engineer. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Linear programming; Mine planning; Open pit design,Computer aided design; Integer programming; Open pit mining; Planning; Critical steps; Economic values; Linear-programming; Mine designs; Mine planning; Open pit; Open pit design; Operational design; Pit mines; Ramp design; Linear programming,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85128266520

Because of this fact, the purpose of this study is to provide outputs and suggestions to the designing engineer regarding the requirements for reducing overall design time as well as costs and creating an ideal design at the early phases of the project by optimizing the aircraft development process. Design methodology approach: The system has been prepared parametrically and presents some performance specifications for the aircraft in the early phases of the design, for example, coefficients for lift CL as well as drag CD and weight as well as fuel estimations. The software uses a combination of well-known design techniques within just one platform in contrast to many other applications. Because of this feature, it is not needed to use different sub-platforms which would require an appropriate environment and even though would lead to complications with regard to the connectivity. The system also presents relevant information about the aircraft performance like velocity versus load factor (V-n) diagrams, maximum turn rate of climb, turn rate and climb angle graphs in contrast to many other open-source conceptual design platforms. Findings: In this study, authentic General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon and McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle data were used as input to the system, and advanced geometric and/or performance graphs were obtained and compared to the literature where a good agreement of the results was observed. These results with regard to the aircraft performance are typically product specific and quite rare in the literature. These data obtained by use of the software during the aircraft design are, thus, of major interest, especially for the design of new aerospace platforms. In this study, all of these graphs (especially the remarkable V-n diagram) are obtained on one platform. Originality value: The aircraft conceptual design and analysis system software provides information and suggestions regarding the requirements for reducing the overall design time, reducing the design costs and creating an optimized design at the early phases of a project by optimizing the aircraft development process within just one convenient, that is, user friendly, platform, where it uses a combination of varying methodologies. Besides presenting one interface, which is quite typical for conceptual design tools, it allows applications of methods like vortex lattices and finite differences for obtaining aerodynamic performance parameters. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Aircraft parametric forecasting; Conceptual design; Conceptual design software,Application programs; Cost benefit analysis; Cost reduction; Graphic methods; Open source software; Open systems; Supersonic aircraft; Vehicle performance; Vortex flow; Aircraft conceptual designs; Aircraft development; Aircraft parametric forecasting; Analysis system; Conceptual analysis; Conceptual design software; Conceptual design system; Design and analysis; Design softwares; Development process; Conceptual design,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85147335254

The technology background behind this phenomenon is called High-Level Synthesis (HLS) and it has been an active research topic for at least the last 3 decades. HLS hasn't been established as a de facto design approach in industry because of problems with the quality of the generated hardware descriptions and the lack of complete automation and compatibility with all the programming constructs that sometimes require manual rewriting of the whole module in order for the HLS tool to be able to process it. One greater problem is that often the available HLS tools generate bugs in the generated hardware which are difficult to trace and correct, as the generated architecture usually contains hundreds of FSM states. Moreover, verification tasks and flows which are disjoint from the synthesis flows often fails to find all bugs and it is difficult to learn and run easy as in the case of formal verification. Here, we discuss a unique verification strategy that it is integrated in the synthesis flow and it doesn't require any verification skills at all, but only how to compile and run C programs, which are driven by run-time options activated by keystrokes. Moreover, because the verified model is the same as this of the synthesis process, it reassures that the verified module is exactly the same as the generated hardware, so the same regression tests can run as in the high-level specification C/Ada program model. The generated cycle accurate simulators are C programs that model the execution of the formal synthesized FSMs. Because of the synthesis transformation formal model with logic inference that we use, the whole synthesis/verification flow of our approach is formal.  © 2023 IEEE.",cycle-accurate simulation; E-CAD; Formal verification; high-level synthesis,C (programming language); High level synthesis; Software testing; C programs; Computing subsystems; Computing system; Cycle-accurate simulation; E-CAD; High performance products; High-level synthesis; Lower energies; Product security; Synthesis tool; Formal verification,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85190068997

The design tool for such systems is the development of ontologies for their subject areas. A problem arises: in our activity, we consider more complex subject areas, and the complexity of ontologies is growing. Is there a limit to this complexity? The design of large-scale systems is already suffocating with complexity - it is difficult to describe the components of the domain, their synthesis is complicated, and even more difficult is the software implementation of the model within the framework of an imperative, object-oriented approach. Debugging the created software system is extremely difficult. The structural theory offers a unified way to describe the subject areas of a broad class of large-scale systems, realizing in this description the principle of 'One in everything and all in One.' Based on this, an end-to-end technology of reporting, synthesis, and software implementation of models of complex, large-scale systems, which is close to CAD methods, is being built. In implementing a software system, it is possible to remain within the framework of declarative programming, avoiding imperative programming, which significantly simplifies its debugging.  © 2023 IEEE.",complex systems; model synthesis; model-oriented programming; programming paradigm; species of structure,Computer aided design; Computer software; Object oriented programming; Ontology; Program debugging; Conceptual model; Large-scale systems; Model synthesis; Model-oriented programming; Ontology's; Programming paradigms; Software implementation; Software-systems; Species of structure; Structural approach; Large scale systems,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85174313950

This surgical process consists of replacing the damaged knee joint with a prosthesis, through surgery where the damaged tissues and part of the bone will be removed so that the prosthesis can be introduced. Despite the good results of total knee arthroplasty, some patients undergoing this operation do not meet their expectations after the operation. This can be due to persistent damage after surgery, which shows that despite the success of the operation, there is still to be explored in the field of orthopedics. In order to reduce the number of revisions of such interventions and to achieve lasting results, it is important to restore joint kinematics. The most recent designs are aimed at creating personalized prostheses for the patients. In this regard, additive manufacturing (AM) offers the opportunity to achieve the objective of custom-made prostheses. Additive manufacturing also creates the opportunity to manufacture accurate prototypes to evaluate and study. It allows performing physical test on accurate replicas of the prothesis and to reduce costs during the design process. This makes a prototype-oriented design methodology an optimal choice to develop new models and create a more effective method to create new prosthesis from a design/engineering perspective. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Additive manufacturing; Biomechanical design; CAD; Design methodology; Modelling software; Non-metallic knee prosthesis,Additives; Arthroplasty; Computer aided design; Diseases; Implants (surgical); Joints (anatomy); Knee prostheses; Orthopedics; Restoration; Biomechanical design; Design Methodology; Joint kinematics; Knee joint; Modeling softwares; Non-metallic; Non-metallic knee prosthesis; Physical tests; Rheumatoid arthritis; Total knee arthroplasty; 3D printing,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85151137273

Prototype emphasizes speed in development based on product prototype iterations to answer user needs. Iterations will be carried out based on an evaluation from the user. In this case, it is deemed necessary to have an evaluation method that can be used to confirm the evaluation basis. This study modifies the prototyping process model in 3 parts: simplifying the requirements definition stage, applying the medium fidelity principle to the application interface prototype design, and applying the System Usability Scale technique, performance efficiency, effectiveness, and heuristic at the evaluation step. This is based on the understanding that this evaluation can indirectly determine how well users receive the application. In order to implement the modified process model, this study uses a case study of smartphone application development for the needs of the Alunalun.info sub-project catalog of Indonesian cultural object information. This project is complex because many other independent sub-projects are also interrelated. The definition of functional requirements for the case study is based on questionnaires and interviews. The definitions obtained were translated into prototypes at medium fidelity based on team and user discussions. Based on this design, applications can be developed immediately.

The proposed framework encompasses a robotic arm with three degrees of freedom (3-DOF) and employs four DC servo motors for each joint's movement. Arm motion control is based on an Arduino control unit, utilizing a Python-based Graphical User Interface (GUI) with a kinematics algorithm in the backend, providing a user-friendly environment for remotely controlling the robot arm's end-effector. The path planning framework is constructed using cubic splines, taking joint restrictions into account.

Throughout the projects we have been developing we have detected, by studying the current literature, a need to develop an agile method to conceive and mapping ontologies, which allows a quick and effective response to RD projects. Designing a method for building an ontology, which is integrated and aligned with a systematic development approach, represents a crucial challenge in new approaches to system design and exploitation. Extant proposed methods for building an ontology, especially following agile approaches, have achieved interesting results but lack integration and alignment with a wider-view development framework. Thus, we have defined the first version of a semantic model allowing the alignment with the previously defined information model. Following the best practices for ontology building and based on our previous work on software system development, we now propose a method for designing an ontology, the 4SRS Method for Ontological Design based on the VModel 4SRS, aligning it with a proven development method. We further demonstrate this approach by applying the proposed method in a real case, to develop an ontology for a choen restricted scope within the domain problem.  © 2023 The Authors.

An AI model was trained to extract geometric features from a dataset of 40 well-known design precedents of shell and tensile structures and to construct a design space. The trained model was then endowed with an interface to allow the designer to explore the design space within CAD software. Unlike the majority of current approaches to parametric design and optimisation, the exploration of the design space - and therefore the interaction between the designer and the computational model - does not take place via design variables, but through visual input. The potential of this tool to support the conceptual design of shell and tensile structures is examined through an application involving iconic design precedents. The application shows that, unlike form-finding and optimisation, this tool generates design suggestions that are not performance-driven, and do not require the statement of the boundary conditions, which would pre-determine the results. Despite this, such design suggestions can be considered plausible because they embed specific design knowledge resulting from a re-elaborating process of the main geometric features of the precedents used to train the AI model. These features include, for example, the shape of the openings, the number and location of the support points or the inversion of curvature, where present. The application results question the role of computational tools in conceptual design and illustrate an alternative strategy to explore the design space.  © 2022 by Gabriele Mirra and Alberto Pugnale.",Artificial Intelligence; computational design; design space exploration; design thinking; shell and tensile structures,Computational methods; Computer aided design; Shells (structures); Computational design; Design precedents; Design space exploration; Design spaces; Design suggestions; Design thinking; Development and applications; Geometric feature; Shell structure; Tensile structures; Conceptual design,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85141233980

The Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program consists of three phases, the first of which is a feasibility study for the innovation. If the innovation is feasible, enter the second stage to finalize the innovative product, and after private and public sector investment, the third phase, commodity promotion and commercialization. The influence of intelligent equipment such as computers and hand-painted boards on the design industry is obvious. With the development of the social economy and the era of technological innovation, a social culture and a value system will be formed. Therefore, the arrival of media technology will also generate perceptions, ways of thinking, and value orientations and will affect our social interaction space, people's main living places, and indoor space. The software module in the computer provides designers with the opportunity to use computer design software to quickly present the designer's ideas on an electronic display screen. Its increasingly convenient design conditions promote the diversity and richness of design software. Combining intelligent multimedia images, with the help of compressed image noise reduction programming, SBIR technology, etc., it has created the development of an interior design. The number of students studying interior design has increased by nearly 60% every year, and the popularity of smart multimedia technology has also reached 78.9%. In the media age, people and interior designers are constantly changing their aesthetic tastes, narrative methods, expression methods, life function needs, and aspirations for a spiritual destination. Good interior design methods do not necessarily produce excellent interior design works, but good interior design works must be guaranteed by a set of practical design techniques and procedures.

The traditional method of producing prosthetic nails is a laborious process often fraught with errors and rejects. In this article, additive manufacturing or 3D printing intervention was sought to make this process less time-consuming and more exacting.Study design and technique:With a focus on finger prosthesis, the process involves reverse engineering a patient's hand using a 3D scanner to obtain a digital blue print for referencing. 3D models of the nail shapes were created using CAD software. Colors sampling is obtained using image processing software from 2D digital images. Using specifically the inkjet technology from Stratasys, batches of nails of different sizes and colors were printed, which were then used for manual adhesion to silicone finger prostheses.Results and conclusions:This article has demonstrated that 3D printing is able to produce nails of comparable quality with those produced by traditional methods in size, shape, curvature, and thickness. More consistent thickness, better size, and shape-matching using 3D files also minimize rejects and grinding time when finishing a prosthesis, leading to significant time savings. However, 3D-printed nails fall short in color match, surface texture, and life-likeness. Traditionally produced nails that are made using a more translucent grade of acrylic than that used in the 3D-printed nails are better able to reproduce the life-like coloration of the translucent human nail. The limitations encountered with 3D printing as applied to prosthetic nails production relate to camera settings, digital image color capture and display, differences in color system used in the printer and monitor, ambient lighting, and suitability of acrylic grade used with the proprietary 3D printing system for material translucency or opacity. © 2022 SAGE Publications Inc..

Density-based methods are generally robust in terms of initial design, making them suitable for designing purposes. However, these methods require relatively fine resolutions for external flow problems to accurately capture the solid-fluid interfaces on Cartesian meshes, which makes them computationally very expensive, particularly for 3D problems. To address such high computational costs, two techniques are developed here. Firstly, an operator-based analytical differentiation (OAD) is proposed, which efficiently computes the exact partial derivatives of the flow solver (simpleFOAM). OAD also facilitates a convenient development process by minimizing hand-coding and utilizing the chain-rule technique, in contrast to full hand-differentiation, which is very complex and prone to implementation errors. Secondly, a multi-stage design process is proposed to further reduce the computational costs. In this technique, instead of using a fixed refined mesh, the optimization processes are initiated with a coarse mesh, and the converged solutions are projected to a locally refined mesh (as an initial guess) for a secondary optimization stage, which can be repeated to obtain a sufficient accuracy. A set of 2D and 3D laminar aerodynamic problems were studied, which promisingly confirmed the utility of the present approach, which can be adopted as a starting point for developing a design tool for large-scale aerodynamic engineering applications. In addition, the 3D problems indicated that less than 3 % of total optimization CPU-time is devoted to OAD, and multi-staging up to 45 % has reduced the overall costs. © 2022, The Author(s).",Discrete adjoint; Laminar aerodynamics; Multi-stage design; OpenFOAM; Operator-based analytical differentiation (OAD); Topology optimization,Aerodynamics; Cost reduction; Laminar flow; Mesh generation; Topology; 3-D problems; Computational costs; Discrete adjoints; Laminar aerodynamic; Multi-stage design; Multi-stages; OpenFOAM; Operator-based analytical differentiation; Optimisations; Topology optimisation; Design,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85127465453

The design and implementation of smart cities require multidisciplinary efforts. As one of the first examples, a smart city concept was developed in Turkey in the year 2018 in collaboration with researchers and experts from various disciplines, such as geomatics and civil engineers, architects, computer scientists and urban planners. The developed concept aimed at designing a city district that targets sustainability, human-centricity, smartness, and safety, along with a sense of place and reflects local expectations in an unconstructed sub-urban area. In the project, the collaborative design process and the usability issues of the presentation environments have been of importance for geomatics professionals. Within the study, the existing settlement areas were modelled by using aerial photogrammetric data and combined with elements designed in various Computer-Aided design (CAD) software. In this paper, the smart city design elements, which originate from the design principles such as ensuring nature conservation, green, cultural, safe and smart living spaces, and social responsibility, are explained briefly. The city was presented to the stakeholders via Unity game engine for a realistic experience prior to construction. The potential of Virtual Reality (VR) environments for the design, modelling, and visualization of very high detailed smart city concept is presented and various issues are discussed.

There are design tools and methods that provide objective criteria for the assessment of the design decisions and their potential for the designed space whilst iterating with feedback. This study intends to explain how scientific data might be functionalized to search for spatialities that have yet to be designed, and Space Syntax was analyzed to see if it could be included in such a process as a scientific approach. Following discussions on the characteristics of the architectural design process, the study focuses on the development and testing of SpaceChase for Grasshopper, a software plug-in that allows designers, architects, and students to build and analyze dynamic and interactive network structures.

The shape of the shoe last is essentially linked to the dimensions of the foot to ensure comfort and good development of the foot for a chosen style. Therefore, a functional analysis of the shoe last is crucial critical to better understand the specificities of each zone. The goal of our current research is to determine the 3D ease allowance between the foot and the shoe last to customize the shoe last. The research was conducted through a 3D design process in a virtual environment. The research begins with a detailed understanding of the general characteristics of the shoe last based on anthropometric line and curves. Later, the planter foot surface for both lower and upper last of the shoe is developed based on the 3D method using the 3D design concept software, which is very similar to the 2D graphic method. To understand how 3D comfort is distributed between the lasts and the foot, the space between the foot and the last is analysed by a reverse procedure in 3D shapes. In the shoe last customization process, both the rear and front foot surface parts were further modelled, and the 3D ease allowance was determined based on a 3D graphical process. The developed customized last model was then accessed not only with good foot surface coverage but also with 3D ease analysis in the virtual environment. The results show that the ease allowance is evenly distributed on the surface of the foot and contributed to the conditions of comfort and blocking of the foot in the shoe. The proposed design process could help designers, developers and the footwear industry to design and develop a customized shoe last with adjustable ease allowance. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.",3D design process; 3D ease allowance; Anthropometry; CAD technology; Shoe fit and comfort; Shoe last customization,Anthropometry; Computer aided design; Virtual reality; 3-d designs; 3d design process; 3d ease allowance; CAD Technologies; Customisation; Design-process; Ease allowance; Shoe fit and comfort; Shoe last; Shoe last customization; Graphic methods,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85141584680

There are various modeling tools (linkage specific and generic CAD tools) available for this purpose, but users are expected to have a certain level of expertise to effectively use these tools. They often take a black box approach whereby no other information between the input and output will be available. Information such as equilibrium equations, loop equations for kinematic analyses, static forces, etc. will be helpful for students as they learn these topics in different courses. For the teaching team, availability of this information will save considerable time while evaluating student work and providing feedback. To enhance student understanding of mechanism design and analysis, and for complementing existing course work, a browser-based application called PMKS+ (Planar Mechanism Kinematic Simulator Plus) is being developed and tested in different courses at Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI). The tool is being designed in such a way that novice users will be able to extract maximum benefit. Mechanisms consisting of different joints (revolute and prismatic), and links of various shapes, can be sketched and analyzed. The analyses that have been integrated include kinematics, and force analyses (static equilibrium and Newton's second law). Data from these analyses can be viewed as plots or exported into a spreadsheet for further analysis and interpretation. Equations corresponding to various analyses can also be viewed in the application. The application was tested in two mechanism-related courses multiple times at WPI where students compared the software generated results with their own MATLAB implementation. The availability of the software also helped the teaching team improve the feedback quality during office hours and help sessions. The student feedback has been highly positive with respect to software usability and applicability to coursework.

Vibration isolation is achieved with help of modal separation by predicting the kinetic energy fraction (KEF) and natural frequency (NF) at each mode. The soft mounts reduce vibrations transferred from the engine to the chassis, but if stiffness is very low, the displacement of the mount will be high, and hence, the lifetime of the mount will be less. Vibration isolation using a powertrain mount is a compromise between the displacement of the mount, displacement of the center of gravity of the powertrain, KEF, and NF. In this paper knowledge-based engineering (KBE) application methodology is explained to initially find out the optimum values of mount parameters using permutation and the combination of mount stiffness, mount angle, and mount locations. Using these permutations and combinations, KEFs, NF, and the displacement of the center of gravity of the powertrain are found. At different loading conditions of the powertrain, results are sorted out based on the highest KEFs and lowest displacement of the center of gravity of the powertrain. Using this approach, the best mount stiffness, mount angle, and mount locations are decided, which ultimately gives a good vibration isolation. Integration of the calculated results with computer-aided design (CAD) software provides the engine envelope with calculated displacement which is used for packaging the engine compartment. All of the above features are verified with a test result and modifications with case studies are proposed to improve the noise, vibration, and harshness (NVH). The objective of this paper is to apply a KBE approach in powertrain mounting system (PMS) design to improve the productivity of the PMS design engineer and accelerate the design and development process. A KBE approach helps to increase the productivity and accuracy of mount designing parameters during the early design stage without the need for computer-aided engineering (CAE) software.  © ",Optimization; Vehicle,Computer aided design; Computer aided engineering; Engine mountings; Engines; Kinetic energy; Kinetics; Knowledge based systems; Powertrains; Application methodology; Center of gravity; Engineering applications; Knowledge-based approach; Knowledge-based engineering; Modal separations; Optimisations; Optimum value; Powertrain mounting system; Vibration isolations; Stiffness,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85145227837

This paper aims to present the development of a platform, which is an internet-based tool integrating the design optimization of desalination systems with spatial modeling based on a geographic information system (GIS). Design/methodology/approach: The proposed platform assists decision-makers to select the optimal location and configuration of both the energy- and water-related subsystems of desalination plants that are power-supplied by RES, such that the lifetime cost of the overall desalination plant is minimized. It enables to optimize the desalination plant site selection and sizing with various hybrid power supply (solar, wind, wave and electrical grid power systems) and desalination technologies combinations, while simultaneously exploiting spatial technologies in an internet-based GIS platform. Findings: A pilot study for the optimal design of stand-alone and grid-connected desalination plants powered by RES is presented, which demonstrates the functionality and features of the proposed platform. It is also shown that a grid-connected desalination plant designed by the proposed software design tool exhibits significantly lower lifetime installation and maintenance costs compared to its stand-alone counterpart. Originality/value: The proposed platform combines technological, scientific and industrial knowledge with information about societal/political conditions and geo-spatial technologies in a user-friendly graphical interface. Therefore, it provides a design tool enabling its users to secure water supply in a sustainable and economically viable manner. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Cost comparison; Cost minimization; Decision-making; Desalination; Electricity; Energy management; Evolutionary programming; Geographical information systems; Optimization; Renewable energies; Renewable energy sources; Simulation,Availability; Decision making; Electric power systems; Environmental technology; Geographic information systems; Natural resources; Potable water; Renewable energy resources; Site selection; Software design; Solar power plants; User interfaces; Water supply; Desalination systems; Desalination technologies; Design optimization; Design/methodology/approach; Graphical interface; Hybrid power supply; Renewable energy source; Spatial technologies; Desalination,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85112058393

However, with advances in time and technology, these techniques could not connect to the new technologies and benefit from the capacities of digitalization. Recent progress in science and technology tends to open new doors to study geometrical patterns by digitalizing the old ones and developing new variations. This study looks at formal grammar and computer science to introduce a new approach to digital visualization of available IGPs, particularly, star patterns. We investigate the potentials of developing a re-writing system for simulation of IGPs to provide a flexible platform, which allows introducing IGP to CAD/CAM software without previous knowledge on their design or drawing techniques. This methodology allows designers to directly develop various scenarios of IGP applications and implement them on related CAD/CAM tools. Formal language and grammar theories, based on applied mathematics are contributing to the advancements of computer science and digital modeling. They can provide an opportunity to express relational definition and written equivalents of the geometries by using strings and symbols. It is supposed that by using the formal grammar frameworks, certain languages could be developed to visualize IGPs in a machine-friendly way, and consequently, this computational interpretation of IGPs facilitates their application and further developments, for example, regards to digital fabrication. The presented method of IGP visualization is developed as a C#-based add-on for Grasshopper in Rhino3D, one of the main modeling tools used by architects and product designers. © The Author(s) 2021.",digital visualization; formal grammar; formal language; Islamic geometric patterns; shape grammar,Computational grammars; Computer aided design; Computer software; Geometry; Modeling languages; Simulation platform; Visualization; Curved surfaces; Digital visualization; Flatter surfaces; Formal grammars; Geometric patterns; Geometrical patterns; Islamic geometric pattern; Recent progress; Science and Technology; Shape grammars; Formal languages,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85122157485

Unlike biomaterials, designers as mediators could collaborate with bioactive polymers as a form of wetware to manufacture living design products with the aid of novel developments in biology and engineering. Past and ongoing experiments in the literature show that BC has a strong nanofibril structure that provides adhesion for attachment to plant cellulose-based networks and it could grow on the surfaces of the desired geometry thanks to its inherited, yet, controllable bio-intelligence. This research explores BC-based bioactive composites as wetware within the context of digital fabrication in which the methodology involves distinct, yet integrated, three main stages: Digital design and G-code generation (software stage); BC cultivation and printable bioactive composite formulation (wetware stage); digital fabrication with a customized 3D printer (hardware stage). The results have shown that the interaction of BC and plant-based cellulose fibers ofjute yarns has enhanced the structural load-bearing capacity of the form against compressive forces, while pure BC is known only by its tensile strength. Since the outcomes were fabricated with the use of a bioactive material, the degradation process also adds a fourth dimension: Time, by which the research findings could further establish a bio-upcycling process of wastes towards biosynthesis of valuable products. Moreover, developing a BC-based bioactive filament indicates potentially a feasible next step in the evolution of multiscale perspectives on the growth of habitable living structures that could reinforce the interaction between nature and architecture through collaboration with software, hardware, and wetware in innovative and sustainable ways. © 2022, Education and research in Computer Aided Architectural Design in Europe.

Generally, a crucial prerequisite for training a robust segmentation neural network is to build a suitable dataset, which requires a large amount of image data with plentiful mold colors, different illumination conditions and specific defect labels. The approach requires long data preparation to collect a sufficient dataset, which could meet the needs of online defect detection during injection molding. To address robust dataset development, the present work uses a 3D CAD modelling software to fabricate defects and colors on molds, creating an augmented mixed dataset with virtual and real-process data. In this investigation, molds printed by vat photopolymerization are used as objects where both the mold images during injection molding process and the virtual mold images from the 3D modelling software are collected. Mixed datasets with different proportions of virtual images are labelled and fed into the segmentation neural network.

The importance of this management is explained by the direct dependence of obtaining the necessary economic and technical results predicted in the working projects of mining units from the effectiveness of managing the project implementation process in practice. The high level of complexity of the tasks of managing the production process requires the development and use of a system of automated control of the production process APCS at a mining enterprise. All such automated control systems already developed at present are aimed at solving only particular tasks of managing certain areas of enterprise activity and are not integrated with each other. This complicates the implementation of this type of production and the efficiency of making managerial decisions on its preparation and implementation. At present, the authors are developing such a process control system, taking into account the requirements for the integration of its technological elements and ensuring consistency in solving the problems of managing the production process at underground iron ore mining enterprises. The methodological provisions on the basis of which the automated control system is being developed provides for a unified fundamental and methodological approach, mathematical, organizational and technical bases that ensure the full integration of its structural elements, consistency in management and organizational decisions. The key element of the automated control system is the computer-aided design system (CAD) of mining units, as the basic elements of the production process at the enterprise. This CAD is designed to solve one of the most difficult tasks in ensuring the functioning of a mining enterprise - the choice of the optimal variant of the mining system for mining units according to the criteria for ensuring the highest economic efficiency of ore extraction. The basic element of CAD is a subsystem for economic and mathematical modeling of the process of developing ore reserves of mining blocks / panels. The totality of these objects are the main production elements of mining enterprises and it is in them that the extraction of ore mass from the ore reserve and the formation of its qualitative and physical and mechanical characteristics are carried out. The process of mining the ore mass forms the main part of the cost of commercial iron ore products produced from it. Based on the decisions made in the working drafts of the set of mining units, the production and technological system of mining enterprises is functioning. The system for managing its functioning organizes this process in such a way as to ensure the development of their reserves with the characteristics, parameters and economic results provided for by the working projects that are developed using CAD. The solution of design problems in CAD is one of the key elements of the entire system for organizing the development process. The authors have developed a block diagram of the cyclical algorithm of this organization, reflecting the logical sequence of management stages and their relationship. This algorithm is the basis of the functional model of the process control system. The described APMS continues to be developed and refined with new structural modules and software blocks. These developments represent the materials of the methodological, organizational, mathematical and program nature of the automated control system, expanding its capabilities. The largest of these developments are: a methodology for computer-aided design of mining enterprises, which determines the structure, functions and operation of the automated control systems of these enterprises, CAD for technological processes of underground mining of iron ores, methodological foundations and rules for ensuring the safety of mining ore deposits, a methodology and software for normalizing extraction indicators ores.  © 2022 IEEE.",aided design system; economic-mathematical modeling; mining; system,Automation; Computer aided design; Computer control systems; Decision support systems; Economic efficiency; Extraction; Information management; Integration; Iron ores; Process control; Production efficiency; Aided design system; Aided designs; Automated control systems; Computer aided design systems; Design systems; Economic mathematical models; Mining enterprise; Organisational; Production process; System; Mining,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85172723842

This applies also to autologous ear reconstruction, a procedure that is performed when patients have a complete or partial lack of the outer ear. On the basis of the contralateral ear, the physician sculpts a portion of costal cartilage that is then placed subcutaneously in the auricular region. Simulation tools can help the physician to familiarize with the specific geometries and shapes of the ear to be reconstructed. Making simulation tools requires the 3D acquisition of the ear, which can be done through optical scanners or diagnostic images (CT scan). This work focused on the development of a non-invasive, low-cost scanner for the acquisition of the outer ear. To this end, Intel RealSense D405 cameras were chosen, and a dedicated structure for the acquisition of ear anatomy was designed and manufactured, coupled with management software. The design of the scanner leveraged tests made with the Blender software for the optimization of the position and number of devices, while ensuring complete ear acquisition. Tests allowed the validation of the instrument both qualitatively, indicating the satisfaction of the medical staff in using the scanner, and quantitatively, measuring the deviation of the acquisition from a reference model obtained with professional scanners. © 2023 CAD Solutions, LLC.",3D Ear Acquisition; CAD Modelling; Optical Scanner; Reverse Engineering,Computer aided design; Diagnosis; Laser recording; Reverse engineering; Software testing; 3-d acquisitions; 3D acquisition; 3d ear acquisition; CAD modeling; Costal cartilages; CT-scan; Diagnostic images; Medical simulations; Optical diagnostics; Optical scanners; Computerized tomography,Article,Final,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85143507517

With the help of 3D measuring systems, the measurement time in design, manufacture, assembly and production is substantially reduced. In this paper, it is proposed to redesign two pieces of a helical pump (driver and driven screws) based on numerical models obtained by scanning. These models are obtained based on the processing of point clouds resulting from the 3D scanning of the respective pieces. After completing the actual scanning process, the numerical models were measured using specific software to determine the dimensional characteristics and their modeling was performed in a computer-aided design program. Subsequently, the inspection was performed by overlapping the scanned model and the CAD model of each piece, in order to be able to compare the analytical models with the real pieces. This comparison allows to appreciate the degree to which the analytical model obtained by redesign corresponds to the real piece. In this way, the ability of future pieces obtained based on the analytical model to be able to accomplish the desired functional role can be appreciated. © 2022, ModTech Publishing House.

The academic community believes that students find the course difficult to grasp and master. However, to revise the course curriculum, identification of threshold concepts and skills can help prioritize topics ensuring alignment with course learning objectives. Objective: The aim of the study was to identify threshold concepts and skills in Software Architecture to help instructors focus on redesigning the curriculum and improving didactics. Method: We applied the Delphi technique to identify threshold concepts and skills from instructors with teaching experience in university-level Software Architecture courses. Results: We identified eleven threshold concepts and nine threshold skills with more than 80% agreement among the participants. Six out of twenty-one threshold concepts and skills achieved 100% agreement from participants indicating high consensus. Furthermore, all participants agreed that applying skills to design Software Architecture is more difficult than understanding the underlying theoretical concepts. Conclusion: The Software Architecture course is demanding, and the industry expects graduating students are prepared to design solutions for complex systems. The identified threshold concepts and skills can help academics to redesign Software Architecture courses, focus on hard to grasp topics, and offer support for skills that are difficult to master. Often theoretical concepts are considered more important than the skills required to apply them in practice. However, instructors agreed that students struggle to apply theoretical concepts in designing solutions. Thus, skills development should be equally emphasized.  © 2022 IEEE.",Software Engineering Education; Teaching Software Architecture; Threshold concepts; Threshold skills,Curricula; Engineering education; Students; Teaching; Academic community; Core course; Course learning Objectives; Delphi technique; Engineering degrees; Software engineering education; Teaching software; Teaching software architecture; Threshold Concepts; Threshold skills; Software architecture,Conference paper,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85149171326

This has resulted in a rapidly increasing number of students enrolling in introductory level CAD courses, producing a flood of digital assignment submissions that need to be evaluated in a timely manner.

However, the type and complexity of CAD model that can be analyzed, and the quality of the feedback that is generated, are still quite limited. In response to this predicament, and also efforts to reform an actual mechanical engineering CAD (MCAD) course, a new approach, framework, and software tool have been developed, based on visual representation and analysis of metrics. These novel instruments are aimed at supporting a more diverse and inclusive analysis and assessment of MCAD models, with a focus on the overall outcome a student produces, which includes model structure, history of model creation, and modeling strategy.

Well-designed urban planning helps in the provision of excellent facilities to the public. Furthermore, it transforms a city into a smart city. Urban planning simplifies the provision of resources, i.e. transportation, communication, water provision, garbage disposal system, etc. The existing construction planning visualizations of 2D CAD and 3D BIM renderings work entirely in virtual digital content, which reduces the graphical object's real-time exposure to the construction process. This work explores some software-driven approaches to visualize 3D layout plans for urban development using Augmented Reality (AR). AR environment gives full-scale walkthroughs of designs to workers and designers. The article analyzes two urban planning scenarios (a) creation of new structures, (b) recreation of existing designs. The creation of new structures is done using Building Information Modeling (BIM) with AR to make 3D layout blueprints come alive. Recreation of existing designs develops BIM after merging two environments together, i.e. already existing structures and designs of new structures. Experimental results consisting of photorealistic AR digital visualizations of indoor as well as outdoor scenes of 3D layouts are used to assess the validity of our approach.

However, the excessive material usage in bracket manufacturing will lead to expensive constructions, increased energy consumption and a rise in carbon footprint. To circumvent these challenges, this paper demonstrates a novel approach for producing an optimum and sustainable steel bracket for pedestrian bridge construction. Topology optimization is used as the tool of choice in this work, which has a proven record of arriving at the highest stiffness to weight ratio. This study uses an existing steel bridge bracket in Castleford Foot Bridge, England as a study case. The bracket is optimized under several volume fractions and ultimately, the optimum design is selected based on both simulation results and practical considerations. It is shown that a considerable amount of material could be saved without sacrificing the strength and stiffness requirement of the bridge bracket. Without a loss of generality, the selected optimal design is manually extracted to a Computer-Aided Design (CAD) software for further post-processing and analysis. © 2022 IEEE.",additive manufacturing; bridge construction; computer-aided design; steel brackets; structural optimization; sustainable designs; topology optimization,3D printers; Carbon footprint; Computer aided analysis; Computer aided engineering; Ecodesign; Energy utilization; Fasteners; Shape optimization; Stiffness; Structural optimization; Sustainable development; Topology; Bridge constructions; Computer-aided design; Design optimization; Energy-consumption; High stiffness; Load-bearing elements; Material usage; Steel brackets; Structural optimisations; Topology optimisation; Computer aided design,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85141201647

Politecnico di Torino in the framework of the I-DREAM, a GSTP contract carried out under the supervision of the European Space Agency (ESA), has developed a unique multidisciplinary methodology and integrated toolset able to support the rapid prototyping of a wide range of aerospace vehicles. iDREAM allows complementing the conceptual design activities with the economic viability and technological sustainability assessments. In detail, the iDREAM methodology consists of four main modules that can be used in a stand-alone mode and in an integrated activity flow, exploiting the implemented automatic connections. The first module consists of a well-structured MySQL database developed to support all the other modules, thanks to a unified connection guaranteed by an ad-hoc developed Database Management Library managing the operations of data input and output from/to the database throughout the tool modules. The second module consists of a vehicle design routine and a mission design routine, supporting the design of a new vehicle and mission concept and assessing the main performance of an already existing configuration. The vehicle design routine is called ASTRID-H, and it is the latest version of an in-house conceptual design tool integrating capabilities ranging from high-speed aircraft to lunar-landers design. The vehicle design routine automatically interfaces with ASTOS, a commercial software environment used for mission analysis optimization. Automatic interactions between the two routines inside the module have been ad-hoc developed and tested to guarantee good accuracy of the results. The third module consists of the economic viability module. Once the design is defined, it is possible to run a subsystem-level cost estimation. Using the subsystems' masses estimated in the design routine, the parametric cost model provides useful insights on the potential development, manufacturing, and operating costs, as well as the cost and price per flight. Eventually, the developed methodology gives the possibility to generate a technology roadmap (fourth module). Supported by a database connection, the tool estimates each technology readiness and risk assessment, along with an indication of the necessary activities, missions, and future works. This paper describes the methodology and the integrated toolset in flight vehicle engineering of Microlaunchers. Eventually, the Electron mission would be used as a benchmark and validation study to showcase the tool's results and accuracy for preliminary design studies. © 2022 International Astronautical Federation, IAF.

Applications based on MSA are distributed applications whose components are microservices. MSA has already been adopted with great success by numerous companies, and a significant number of published papers discuss its advantages. However, the results of recent studies show that there are several important challenges in the adoption of microservices such as finding the right decomposition approach, heterogeneous technology stacks, lack of relevant skills, out-of-date documentation, etc. In this paper, we present Silvera, a Domain-Specific Language (DSL), and a compiler for accelerating the development of microservices. Silvera is a declarative language that allows users to model the architecture of microservice-based systems. It is designed so that it can be used both by inexperi-enced and experienced developers. The following characteristics distinguish Silvera from similar tools: (i) lightweight and editor-agnostic language, (ii) built with heterogeneity in mind, (iii) uses microservice-tailored metrics to evaluate the architecture of the designed system, and (iv) automatically generates the documentation. Silvera’s retargetable compiler transforms models into runnable code and produces the documentation for each microservice in the model. The compiler can produce code for any programming language or framework since code generators are registered as plugins. We present a case study that illustrates the use of Silvera and also discuss some current limitations and development directions. To evaluate Silvera, we conducted a survey based on A Framework for Qualitative Assessment of DSLs (FQAD), where we focused on the following DSL characteristics: functional suitability, usability, reliability, productivity, extendability, and expressiveness. Overall, the survey results show that Silvera satisfies these characteristics. © 2022 by the authors.

This simplified element model considers as follows: (1) an elastoplastic spring with a smooth transition between branches; (2) a linear elastic spring; and (3) a non-linear elastic spring, and is fully defined by only six parameters. The main advantages of the simplified model are twofold: (1) versatility, as a single model is capable of accurately reproducing the main characteristics of the hysteretic behavior of different types of rubber-based seismic isolators, including low damping rubber bearings (LDRBs), high damping rubber bearings (HDRBs), and lead-core rubber bearings (LRBs) and (2) simplicity, as it requires fewer parameters and it is easier to calibrate from experimental cyclic test results than most currently available models. Model parameters’ identification is illustrated using quasi-static cyclic and earthquake simulator tests of HDRBs and LRBs, demonstrating that the model shows a good agreement between the test-measured and model-predicted hysteretic behavior. Different objective functions are evaluated in the optimization procedure, and their effect on the identified parameters is studied and discussed. This practitioner-oriented model is particularly amenable for implementation in general-purpose structural analysis software. Its usage is strongly recommended as an initial-stage design tool to select the optimal isolation system for a specific project. © The Author(s) 2021.",Elastomeric isolation; elastomeric isolation modeling; high damping rubber bearings; lead-core rubber bearings; non-linear time history analysis; seismic isolation bearings; seismic isolation modeling,Damping; Hysteresis; Nonmetallic bearings; Rubber; Seismology; Springs (components); Earthquake simulator; High damping rubber bearings; Identified parameter; Objective functions; Optimization procedures; Seismic isolation bearings; Structural analysis softwares; Two dimensional model; accuracy assessment; calibration; computer simulation; damping; earthquake engineering; hysteresis; numerical model; seismic design; seismic isolation; seismic response; structural analysis; two-dimensional modeling; Bearings (structural),Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85112731470

The key objective is to store the whole system design in one single source of truth system model. The continuously maintained and customizable open-source MBSE tool Virtual Satellite developed by the German Aerospace Center (DLR) offers a framework for storing such a system model. Since the open-source 3D computer aided design (CAD) software FreeCAD has a dedicated Virtual Satellite workbench for importing the 3D model file generated by Virtual Satellite, it is possible to export the 3D model from Virtual Satellite, apply changes to it in FreeCAD, and afterwards reimport it in Virtual Satellite. This paper presents a workflow implementation to conduct automated steady-state and transient thermal analyses using the Virtual Satellite system model as a basis, utilizing the aforementioned features. Part of this effort was to extend Virtual Satellite by thermal modeling capabilities, such as material parameters, surface characteristics, thermal interfaces, boundary conditions and further relevant aspects. With custom Java applications, so-called ""Apps"", all aspects of the system model relevant for a thermal analysis are exported from Virtual Satellite and written to accordingly generated text files. Moreover, the before described 3D model export is used to export the model to FreeCAD. The FreeCAD Python console, in combination with the finite element method (FEM) workbench, is used to create a script that executes meshing, application of the boundary and initial conditions, as well as identification of contacts between parts and application of the specified contact conductance values. The obtained files form a complete thermal model and can be fed directly into the open-source FEM software CalculiX for executing the thermal analysis. Then, the result can be processed by an additional Virtual Satellite App. To account for the space thermal environment an additional feature was added to the FreeCAD script. The feature uses orbit information obtained from external mission analysis tools (e.g., Satellite Tool Kit, STK) to calculate the approximate combined heat load from Sun, Earth infrared, and albedo radiation at each time point in the specified simulation time interval. This new workflow allows to execute quick thermal analyses at an early design stage and therefore opens new opportunities in the evaluation of different system designs, as early as in a concurrent engineering study. Configuration parameters are provided that also allow more sophisticated analyses in later development phases, such as custom mesh definition and local mesh refinement. © 2022 International Astronautical Federation, IAF.

These activities are applicable to a wide variety of engineering applications, but are particularly applicable to upstream bioprocessing, such as raw material pretreatment, microbial metabolite production, and formulation. In a typical fermentation process, the key variables associated with pretreatment of raw material, media formulation, and process development are always under the control of an investigator. But, when such studies involve three or even more key variables it is certainly not under the investigator’s control to possibly extract useful information like notions of interaction between the same of a full factorial system. In turn, the applicability of statistical software packages that have good data analytics has become mandatory for constructive evaluation of design parameters and extensive analysis features. Thus statistically designed experiments would offer a valid basis for developing an empirical and mathematical model.

This paper is the second part, which outlines various processes, loads, design approaches and project management of offshore platforms. To achieve these, proper planning must be conducted for lifting, transportation, installation, design, fabrication, and commissioning of these offshore platforms. Some historical developments of some offshore structures are presented, and some project planning routines are undertaken in this research. The ultimate goal is to provide a general overview of the many processes of offshore platform design, construction, loadout, transportation, and installation.

Numerical simulations for engineering design applications become more challenging with increase of scale since current velocity fields are no longer uniform, complicating accurate hydrodynamic load calculations. Horizontal and vertical velocity profiles in this case are spatially (depth and particular location within the deployment site) and temporary (date and time) dependent. Thus, proper representation of the current velocity field in numerical models becomes crucial for accurate predictions of structural performance of aquaculture installations. In this paper, an advanced multidimensional approximation method based on discrete current velocity data is formulated. The approach implies presenting the continuous current velocity function as a superposition of weighted radial basis functions extended by a linear polynomial. To address overfitting issues, the thin plate regularization is applied in the method. The approximation is then constrained in order to fit the velocity values on the domain boundaries. The method is implemented in finite element software Hydro-FE and its performance is compared to other approximation methods on the example of a kelp grow line deployed at the Wood Island research site, Maine, USA. It was found that the difference between regular (mean or linearly interpolated) velocity profiles and the velocity profiles approximated with the radial basis function method can reach up to 34–38 % in terms of grow line mooring tensions, and 6–18% in terms of grow line displacement. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Field measurements; Finite element analysis; Large-scale installations; Radial basis function,Maine; United States; Aquaculture; Functions; Numerical models; Offshore oil well production; Radial basis function networks; Velocity; Approximation methods; Base function; Current velocity; Field measurement; Finite element analyse; Large-scale installation; Large-scales; Radial base function; Radial basis; Velocity field; aquaculture industry; current velocity; field method; finite element method; installation; methodology; offshore application; Finite element method,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85135927061

Even with state-of-the-art CT technology, calcium blooming artifacts may limit the accuracy of coronary stenosis assessment. A variety of solutions to reduce blooming artifacts have been proposed, including hardware improvements, protocol optimizations, and software deblooming techniques [1-6]. Hardware developments and clinical studies (for protocol optimization or training data generation) can be expensive, time-consuming, and impractical. Hence, there is an opportunity for a Virtual Clinical Trial (VCT) framework [7-8] to help researchers to evaluate the impact of various solutions on calcium blooming and to create training datasets for developing deep learning solutions for deblooming. In this paper, we present a new VCT framework for generating cardiac CT images with calcium blooming with a variety of CT hardware parameters, CT scan protocols and CT reconstruction kernels. As an example, we use the VCT framework to investigate the impact of three common scan and reconstruction parameters (X-ray tube voltage, focal spot size, and reconstruction kernel) on calcium blooming artifacts. We conclude that tube voltage and reconstruction kernel have the most direct impact on calcium blooming, which is consistent with earlier clinical reports [9-12]. © 2022 SPIE.",Calcium blooming; Cardiac CT; Computed tomography,Calcium; Computerized tomography; Deep learning; Heart; Medical imaging; Noninvasive medical procedures; X ray tubes; Calcium blooming; Cardiac CT; Clinical trial; Computed tomography; Coronary artery disease; Noninvasive methods; Protocol optimization; Reconstruction kernel; Therapeutic intervention; Virtual imaging; Diseases,Conference paper,Final,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85141766033

Mesh generation plays a fundamental role in numerical simulations in the area of computer aided design and engineering (CAD/E). It is identified as one of the critical issues in the NASA CFD Vision 2030 Study. Existing mesh generation methods suffer from high computational complexity, low mesh quality in complex geometries, and speed limitations. These methods and tools, including commercial software packages, are typically semiautomatic and they need inputs or help from human experts. By formulating the mesh generation as a Markov decision process (MDP) problem, we are able to use a state-of-the-art reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm called “soft actor-critic” to automatically learn from trials the policy of actions for mesh generation. The implementation of this RL algorithm for mesh generation allows us to build a fully automatic mesh generation system without human intervention and any extra clean-up operations, which fills the gap in the existing mesh generation tools. In the experiments to compare with two representative commercial software packages, our system demonstrates promising performance with respect to scalability, generalizability, and effectiveness. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",Computational geometry; Mesh generation; Neural networks; Quadrilateral mesh; Reinforcement learning; Soft actor–critic,"Algorithms; Humans; Reinforcement, Psychology; Complex networks; Computer aided design; Deep learning; Learning algorithms; Markov processes; Mesh generation; MESH networking; NASA; Software packages; Actor critic; Automatic mesh generation; Commercial software; Computational framework; Computer-aided design; Neural-networks; Quadrilateral meshes; Reinforcement learning algorithms; Reinforcement learnings; Soft actor–critic; article; artificial neural network; computer aided design; computer simulation; geometry; human; human experiment; learning; Markov decision process; reinforcement learning (machine learning); software; velocity; vision; algorithm; Reinforcement learning",Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85141460169

The success of promising therapeutics for CVDs is challenging, as traditional treatments are not cost-effective or efficient in curing CVDs. Computer-aided drug design (CADD) has egressed as an effective means of formulating drugs to treat several diseases, and their applications have a promising role in day to day in drug discovery. Methods: This review focuses on discussing the potential application of CADD approaches in developing new therapeutic molecules related to the prevention of CVDs. Also, it describes the various approaches involved in CADD techniques ranging from structure-based to ligand-based drug design. In this perspective, an extensive literature survey was carried out to understand the potential application of CADD to develop new therapeutic entities to treat CVDs. Results: CADD approaches have been implemented by both the pharmaceutical industry and regulatory agencies. The application of CADD programs such as quantum mechanics and molecular modeling studies have accelerated the progress of the new drug development process against CVDs. In silico, ADMET models can predict the pharmacokinetic properties to select the effectiveness and bioavailability of new molecules. Conclusion: The computational tools or drug design software play a crucial role in improving drug discovery and development in the pharmaceutical industry. CADD can assist researchers in studying interactions between drug molecules and receptors. Thus, CADD will be helpful for the discovery and a better understanding of new drug entities. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Ligand-based drug design; Molecular docking; QSAR; Software; Structure-based drug design,cardiovascular agent; cardiovascular disease; computer aided design; computer model; drug adsorption; drug bioavailability; drug design; drug distribution; drug excretion; drug metabolism; drug screening; human; molecular docking; molecular model; pharmacophore; quantitative structure activity relation; quantum mechanics; Review,Review,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85119050722

Consequently, a derivation and implementation of a robot dynamic model, which is used for purposes of control, simulation, and mechanical design, often represents a challenging task. The last couple of decades saw a great amount of research with the aim to achieve better ease of use (development) and computational efficiency of robot dynamic algorithms. Recently, general-purpose robot modeler/simulator software that enables numerical calculation of robot inverse dynamics problem for user-developed robot model and input joint trajectories are being increasingly used by a wider range of robot developers for robot control purposes. In this study, two different practical approaches to account for robot dynamics for purposes of robot control, trajectory generation, mechanical design and simulation, are discussed. The first approach includes an efficient solution for forward dynamics using a novel modified recursive Newton–Euler algorithm, which is used for simulation, mechanical design, and trajectory generation. The second approach is based on modern software tools usage, for the purposes of simulation and control. Both strategies for implementation of robot dynamic model are based on developed 3D models of robots in CAD software and 3D modelers. Applied approaches are demonstrated in three different case studies.

Previous publications focus on error-free triangulation or transformation of product structure data and display attributes for AR/VR applications. This paper focuses on the preparation of the required geometry data. In this context, a significant reduction in effort can be achieved through automation. The steps of geometry preparation are identified and examined concerning their automation potential. In addition, possible couplings of sub-steps are discussed. Based on these explanations, a structure for the geometry preparation process is proposed. With this structured preparation process, it becomes possible to consider the available computing power of the target platform during the geometry preparation. The number of objects to be rendered, the tessellation quality, and the level of detail (LOD) can be controlled by the automated choice of transformation parameters. Through this approach, tedious preparation tasks and iterative performance optimization can be avoided in the future, which also simplifies the integration of AR/VR applications into product development and use. A software tool is presented in which partial steps of the automatic preparation are already implemented. After an analysis of the product structure of a CAD file, the transformation is executed for each component. Functions implemented so far allow, for example, the selection of assemblies and parts based on filter options, the transformation of geometries in batch mode, the removal of certain details, and the creation of UV maps. Flexibility, transformation quality, and timesavings are described and discussed.

However, this management task still poses great challenges for building authorities, as they are usually responsible for large, heterogeneous and long-lived built assets with countless of data sets and documents that are increasingly changing from analogue to digital representations. These digital collections are characterized by complex dependencies, by numerous different, sometimes highly specialized and proprietary formats and also by their inappropriate organization. The major challenge is to ensure completeness, consistency and usability over the entire lifecycle of buildings or their associated digital data and documents. In this paper, we present an approach for a holistic and standard-based concept for a technical and organizational solution in building authorities. Holistic means integrating concepts for the long-term usability of digital building information, taking into account the framework conditions described in building authorities, including the introduction of BIM (building information modeling). To this end, we outline how the concepts of the consolidated and widely accepted ISO-standardized reference model OAIS (open archive information system) can be applied to a building-specific information architecture. First, we sketch the history of electronic data processing in the building sector and introduce the essential concepts of OAIS. Then, we illustrate typical major actors and their (future) IT systems, including systems intended for OAIS-compliant long-term usability. Next, we outline major (future) software components and their interactions and assignment to lifecycle phases. Finally, we delineate how the generic information model of OAIS can be used. In summary, ensuring the long-term usability of digital information in the building sector will remain a grand challenge, but our proposed approach to the systematic application and further refinement of the OAIS reference model can help to better organize future discussions as well as research, development and implementation activities. We conclude with some suggestions for further research based on the concepts of the OAIS reference model, such as refining information models or developing information repositories needed for long-term interpretation of digital objects.  © 2022 ACM.",building authority; building information modeling (BIM); building lifecycle; CAD; datArena; digital building documents; document lifecycle; document management; long-term archiving; OAIS; ultra long-term preservation,Architectural design; Data handling; Digital libraries; Historic preservation; Information management; Information services; Information theory; Life cycle; Building authority; Building information modeling; Building Information Modelling; Building life cycle; Datarena; Digital building document; Document life-cycle; Document management; Long-term archiving; Long-term preservation; Open archive information system; Open archives; Ultra long-term preservation; Computer aided design,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85143162684

Since 2020, the course at Politecnico di Milano “Architecture for Human Space Exploration"" for the School of Architecture, Urban Planning, and Construction Engineering is implementing this multi-disciplinarity thanks to external reviewers, that are experts in the Space Architecture domain, and the collaboration, in the actual A.Y. 2021-22, with the Webinar Series at MIT Media Lab “Design Exploration: towards a Moon Architecture"". The Webinar Series, open to all MIT and Harvard students, addressed numerous topics and aspects of designing a lunar settlement with several experts about history of space architecture, crewed missions, habitation systems and habitability requirements, In Situ Resources Utilization, Human Factor Design principles, radiation shielding technologies, sustainability of space exploration, and inspirational talks. The talks gathered space architects, engineers and professionals from NASA JPL, NASA JSC and ESA, astronauts, faculty from different universities (University of Houston - SICSA, UW-Madison, Université Paris-Saclay, SDU, University of Bologna, Politecnico di Milano, MIT Media Lab and MIT AeroAstro) and companies (Trotti Studio, Thales Alenia Space, SOM, ICON). Indeed, the students attending this collaborative classroom had to develop a space architecture project for the Moon or Mars. Therefore, the possibility to actively participate to this Webinar Series resulted extremely effective since students applied the acquired knowledge directly to their Space Architecture projects.

Researchers have proposed a number of physical and architectural countermeasures against fault-injection attacks; however, these techniques usually come with large overhead and design efforts making them difficult to use in practice. In addition, the current electronic design automation (EDA) tools are not fully equipped to support vulnerability assessment against fault-injection attacks at the design-time for secure hardware development. To perform a design-time (i.e., presilicon) evaluation of such attacks, a designer should be aware of various security vulnerabilities and must perform a tedious manual design review, which is time-consuming and hard to ensure effectiveness. Therefore, it is very important to develop an automatic assessment framework to identify the most security-critical locations in a design to fault-injection attacks and place emphasis on protecting those locations. In this article, we propose an automated framework for fault-injection vulnerability assessment of designs at gate-level, while considering the design-specific security properties (SPs) using novel models and metrics. The proposed framework identifies the faults that can violate the SPs of the design. As a result, applying local countermeasures will be more effective and the protection overhead will be reduced significantly. Our experimental results on the SP of AES, RSA, and SHA implementations show that the security threat from fault-injection attacks can be significantly mitigated by protecting the identified critical locations, which are less than 0.6% of the design.  © 1982-2012 IEEE.",Computer-aided design (CAD); fault-injection attack; hardware security; security property (SP); vulnerability assessment,Availability; Computer aided design; Electronic assessment; Hardware security; Integrated circuit design; Integrated circuits; Location; Software testing; Timing circuits; Automatic assessment; Electronic design automation tools; Fault injection attacks; Hardware development; Security properties; Security vulnerabilities; Security-critical; Vulnerability assessments; Network security,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85102275429

Concepts such as simultaneous engineering aim for a product creation process, which addresses both, functional requirements as well as requirements from production. However, existing concepts mostly focus on organizational tasks and heavily rely on the human factor for the exchange of complex information across different domains, organizations, or systems. Nowadays product and process design make use of advanced software tools such as computer-aided design, manufacturing, and engineering systems (CAD/CAM/CAE). Modern systems already provide seamless integration of both worlds in a single digital environment to ensure a continuous workflow. Yet, for the holistic harmonization between product and process design, the following aspects are missing: (i) the digital environment does not provide a complete and data consistent digital twin of the component; this applies especially to the process design and analysis environment, (ii) due to the lack of process and part condition data in the manufacturing environment, an adaptation of product and process design for a balanced functionality and manufacturability is hindered, and (iii) systematic long-term data analytics across different product and process designs with the ultimate goal to transfer knowledge from one product to the next and to accelerate the entire product development process is not considered. This paper presents an exploration concept which couples product design (CAD), process design (CAM), process simulation (CAE), and process adaptation in a single software system. The approach provides insights into correlations and dependencies between input parameters of product/process design and the process output. The insights potentially allow for a knowledge-based adaptation, tackling well-known optimization issues such as parameter choice or operation sequencing.

To this end, Neural Concept exploits the power of deep learning to assist engineers to more quickly evaluate man-made designs and to guide them to more performing solutions. Our algorithms act as a force multiplier to humans’ creativity and help them come up more quickly with innovative designs that meet a variety of complex requirements. It uses the following approach: • Broadening the reach of simulation and optimization-driven design. Because of their historical origin, simulation tools are not well adapted to design optimization in production environments. It is extremely hard for design teams to leverage insights provided by advanced simulations and by the specialized teams who develop them. Neural Concept resolves this by integrating interactive simulation and design optimization tools in the workflow of the design engineers, instead of delegating this task to separate expert teams. Furthermore, the great engineering feats of our times, such as modern cars, airplanes, or nuclear submarines, have not been achieved by a few individuals with powerful ideas or algorithms. Instead, they are the result of a fragile network of interactions between hundreds of engineering teams, each with its own expertise. In that context, removing the friction introduced by simulations and lengthy back-and-forth technical exchanges dramatically improves the dynamics of large-scale engineering design. • Empowering creativity. Even in the hands of experts, past design tools do not deliver much in the way of radical innovation. They are typically used either to choose optimal configurations given a few predefined tuneable parameters or to make minor local adjustments to manually-built designs. This is a far cry from making major design decisions and guiding engineers towards bold new ideas, which is what we enable. The future requires making computer-driven exploration the central paradigm of engineering design processes, to broaden its scope of use. Neural Concept was created to promote and realize this vision, to empower every engineer, in every engineering organization to discover the very best. In this talk, we explain how Neural Concept’s Software, NCS, powered by recent algorithms based on Geometric Deep-Learning, allows shortcutting any simulation chain through a predictive model that outputs post processed results right from the CAD design. These models are being used in engineering companies to simplify processes and to emulate the expertise of simulation engineers in the hands of product or design engineers early in the development process. Thus, the number of iterations between teams are reduced while accelerating the design activities. © 2022 The authors.",,Computer aided design; Deep learning; Engineering education; Product design; Automotive suppliers; Automotive-OEM; Computational resources; Design engineers; Design optimization; Drive systems; Engineering organizations; Fast transition; Force multipliers; Power; Engineers,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85175795471

One of the innovation directions at the centre of attention is reusable and refillable packaging. In various forms, these are being researched for their potential to act as a packaging concept, and developed as a market-ready alternative to one-way or single-use packaging. Both in the European Commission’s Circular Economy Action Plan and packaging strategies developed by the Ellen MacArthur Foundation, reusable packaging is adopted as a valuable scenario. In this research, we set out to develop a decision support tool that can assist in developing product-packaging combinations for reuse/refill scenarios. The development of the tool is based on a designerly approach, combining literature research and interviews with industry stakeholders applying reusable packaging concepts in their product marketing, or considering to do so. Complexities in the development and application of the tool do not only come from specific product-packaging combinations, but also from the system in which these interact: retail, use, reverse logistics, and repurposing require an overhaul of their impact. The developed tool is tested by means of a multi-concept analysis, and a reflection. Eight student groups are invited to design reusable/refillable packaging concepts, for a product of their choice. Analysing the designs with the tool provides insights into the decision-making process, and a set of potential redesign considerations. With this, we assess the value of the designed concepts and the benefits of the tool for decision-making processes when developing reusable packaging concepts. The latter point is valuable for comparison to other packaging decision-making tools, and to be able to make improvements. In follow-up research, we set out to apply the decision support tool for industry-based design processes, to understand its usability for packaging designers. © Conference Proceedings - 23rd IAPRI World Conference on Packaging, IAPRI Bangkok 2022.

The ability to directly use a computer-aided design (CAD) model has allowed for fabricating and realizing complicated components, monolithic design, reducing the number of components in an assembly, decreasing time to market, and adding performance or comfort-enhancing functionalities. One of the features that can be introduced for boosting a component functionality using AM is the inclusion of surface texture on a given component. This inclusion is usually a difficult task as creating a CAD model resolving fine details of a given texture is difficult even using commercial software packages. This paper develops a methodology to include texture directly on the CAD model of a target surface using a patch-based sampling texture synthesis algorithm, which can be manufactured using AM. Input for the texture generation algorithm can be either a physical sample or an image with heightmap information. The heightmap information from a physical sample can be obtained by 3D scanning the sample and using the information from the acquired point cloud. After obtaining the required inputs, the patches are sampled for texture generation according to non-parametric estimation of the local conditional Markov random field (MRF) density function, which helps avoid mismatched features across the patch boundaries. While generating the texture, a design constraint to ensure AM producibility is considered, which is essential when manufacturing a component using, e.g., Fused Deposition Melting (FDM) or Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF). The generated texture is then mapped onto the surface using the developed distance and angle preserving mapping algorithms. The implemented algorithms can be used to map the generated texture onto a mathematically defined surface. This paper maps the textures onto flat, curved, and sinusoidal surfaces for illustration. After the texture mapping, a stereolithography (STL) model is generated with the desired texture on the target surface. The generated STL model is printed using FDM technology as a final step. © 2022, The Author(s).",Design for additive manufacturing; Image processing; Texture mapping; Texture synthesis; Textured surface generation,3D printers; Additives; Computer aided design; Conformal mapping; Image texture; Magnetorheological fluids; Markov processes; Structural frames; Computer aided design models; Design for additive manufacturing; Images processing; Surface generations; Target surface; Texture generation; Texture mapping; Texture synthesis; Textured surface; Textured surface generation; Textures,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85134238396

This paper proposes a new OpenSim-Simulink interface, with a simple programming procedure, for the zero-force control of human-exoskeleton interactions. A skeletal model of the human body and a CAD model of a custom-made hip exoskeleton is developed in the OpenSim Software. The Torso link of the robot is rigidly attached to the human pelvis. At the same time, bushing forces are used to develop a compliant contact between the link of the robot and the human thigh. The hip joints of the robot are aligned with the corresponding human joints, and coordinate actuators are used to actuate the extension/flexion DOF of the robot's hip. Then, establishing the simple OpenSim-Simulink interface, some algorithms are designed in Simulink to control the human motions and to adjust the human-robot interaction forces. In this paper, two different force control methods are designed to minimize the human-robot interaction forces. This first method is a fuzzy controller with force and joint angle feedback, and the second method is a cascaded controller with two feedback loops of the force error and the force derivative. The developed OpenSim-Simulink interface is used to implement the designed force controllers and compare their performances. The results verify that by using the designed controllers, the robot successfully tracks the human leg motion, and the interaction force is effectively reduced. The results also indicate the outperformance of the cascaded controller with an 86.66% reduction in the peak interaction force compared to the 80% reduction achieved by the fuzzy controller. © 2022 IEEE.",Cascaded Force Controller; Fuzzy Force controller; Human-Exoskeleton Interaction; OpenSim-Simulink Interface; Zero-Force Control,Computer aided design; Controllers; Exoskeleton (Robotics); Feedback; Force control; Human robot interaction; Man machine systems; Cascaded force controller; Force controller; Fuzzy force controller; Human-exoskeleton interaction; Interaction forces; OpenSim; Opensim-simulink interface; Simulink; Zero-force control; Simulink,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85148089770

We then focus on the problem of software development productivity in the area of automated software generation as the main factor of the Industry 4.0 concept in the area of business information. In our study, two different approaches to user interface development in a business process management low-code platform were evaluated. The first, the multi-form model, assumes that input forms are prepared separately for each user task in the business process being automated. The second approach, the single-form model, assumes that there is one global input form for every task in the business process. Since users have access to different data in different process tasks, it is necessary to prepare the visibility matrix to define which data are relevant to which tasks. The experiments presented in this paper help to answer the following question: which approach yields better results in terms of productivity, which is measured as costs and time required to prepare the application? Several dozen real business processes were analysed to examine the properties of their visibility matrix. Additionally, the real project team members were evaluated to determine their productivity. Then, the productivity parameters were calculated for real business processes and real project teams. The results show which approach is better suited for real-world business process development. © 2022 by the authors.

The design complexity in this field is because all key components are subject to high and time-varying stresses. Top teams in high-tech categories can invest large amounts of money in developing and applying sophisticated CAE systems. Such economic commitment is not sustainable for all those teams operating in strategic categories where the production of vehicles and their components are in the hands of small realities, such as karts or mini-motorcycles. In these fields, the most common design approach is the trial and error on physical prototypes. Such an inefficient approach leads to high costs, and, for the rough exploration of the design space, a very low innovation for every component. To overcome these limitations, the presented paper proposes a systematic methodology for the structural design of high-speed engine parts, accessible also to small artisan teams. The method is based on the use of commercial CAD and CAE software; it analyses a 3D CAD model comprising all the components of the whole kinematic chain to which the element to be considered belongs. The FE model is built by setting appropriate boundary conditions on all the components of the above-mentioned chain and imposing, on the element to be studied, for each kinematic configuration, all the acting loads, including the inertial ones. This methodology is here applied to the redesign of a connecting rod of the engine for go-kart competitions. The obtained results are critically discussed and compared with the key methods available in the literature: static analysis and quasi-dynamic analysis. The results evidence methods presented in the literature do no work in presence of high inertia loads: for some crank angles, the stress level got is higher than the yield stress. Instead, by using the proposed method, the consistency of safety coefficient values with those available in the literature is obtained. The proposed methodology could lead to an increase in innovation and in a time and cost reduction during the development process of the motorsport engines having a high specific power obtained with high rotation speeds. This could determine a decrease in the cost of race vehicles with an expansion of potential practitioners of these strategic categories. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag France SAS, part of Springer Nature.",Connecting rod optimization; Fatigue; FE model; High inertia loads,3D modeling; Cams; Computer aided design; Connecting rods; Cost reduction; Engines; Finite element method; Geometry; Kinematics; Static analysis; Structural design; Yield stress; Connecting rod optimization; Design and optimization; Equipment design; FE model; High inertia load; High-speed engines; Motor-sport; Motorsports; Numerical methodologies; Optimisations; Fatigue of materials,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85122747709

The main features of PolyRec GDT include the ability to collect gestures directly on mobile devices, to detect similarities between gestures to help the designer to detect ambiguities in the design phase, and the ability to automatically select the most representative gestures for each gesture class by using a clustering technique to increase recognition speed without affecting accuracy. Experimental results show that this latter feature allows an increase in accuracy compared with when the same operation is performed manually by developers or randomly by software. Finally, a user study was carried out to evaluate PolyRec GDT, in which participants were asked to use it to add gesture functionality to a mobile application.

CAD software is a software platform that provides the process from designing to modeling, such as AutoCAD or FreeCAD. Due to complex functions, the quality of CAD software plays an important role in designing reliable 2D and 3D models. There are many dependencies between defects in CAD software. Software testing is a practical way to detect defects in CAD software development. However, it is expensive to frequently run all the test cases for all functions. In this paper, we design an approach to learning to prioritize test cases for the CAD software, called PriorCadTest. The key idea of this approach is to quantify functional units and to train a learnable model to prioritize test cases. The output of the approach is a sequence of existing test cases. We evaluate PriorCadTest on seven modules of an open-source real-world CAD project, ArtOfIllusion. The Average Percentage of Fault Detect (APFD) is used to measure the effectiveness. Experimental results show that the proposed approach outperforms the current industrial practice without test case prioritization. © 2022 by the authors.",CAD software; computer aided design; feature engineering; manufacturing software; software testing; test case prioritization,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85140656003

The course is taught in the Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) Department at the University of Texas at Arlington and is offered as CSE 4356 System on Chip Design for computer engineering undergraduates, as CSE 5356 for computer engineering graduate students, and as EE 5315 for electrical engineering graduate students. It is taught as one course combining all numbers. All students are given the same lectures, course materials, assignments, and projects. Grading standards and expectations are the same for all students as well. The course in its current form was first offered in fall 2020 and was taught online due to COVID-19 restrictions. The course was offered again in fall 2021 in a traditional on-campus, in-person mode of delivery. Two seasoned educators, with more than eighty years of total teaching experience, combined to team teach the course. One also brought more than thirty years of industrial design experience to the course. SoC FPGA devices have been available for use by designers for more than 10 years and are widely used in applications that require both an embedded microcomputer and FPGA-based logic for real-time computationally-intense solutions. Such solutions require skills in C programming, HDL programming, bus topologies forming the bridge between FPGA fabric and the microprocessor space, Linux operating systems and virtualization, and kernel device driver development. The breadth of the skills that were conveyed to students necessitated a team teaching approach to leverage the diverse background of the instructors. With such a wide range of topics, one of the biggest challenges was developing a course that was approachable for a greatly varied population of students - a mix of Computer Engineering (CpE) and Electrical Engineering (EE) students at both the graduate and undergraduate level. Another, perhaps less obvious, challenge was the inherently application focus of the course, which presents challenges to many graduate students whose undergraduate degree lacked a robust hands-on design experience. Selection of an appropriate project was key to making the course effective and providing a fun learning experience for students. The projects were aligned to relevant industry applications, stressing complex modern intellectual property (IP) work flows, while still being approachable to students. The design of a universal asynchronous receiver transmitter (UART) IP module in 2020 and a serial peripheral interface (SPI) IP module in 2021 were chosen as the projects for the first two offerings of the course. The Terasic/Intel DE1-SoC development board and Intel Quartus Prime 18.1 design software were the technologies chosen for the course. The development board and basic test instruments were provided to each student in a take-home lab kit. The system on chip design course has proven to be a popular but challenging course for our undergraduate and graduate students in computer engineering and electrical engineering. The course has demonstrated that it is possible to successfully teach an advanced design-oriented course to students of varying majors, levels, educational backgrounds, and cultures. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2022.",,Application specific integrated circuits; C (programming language); Computer hardware description languages; Computer operating systems; Curricula; Engineering education; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); Grading; Intellectual property; Intellectual property core; Programmable logic controllers; System-on-chip; Teaching; Computer engineering; Computer science and engineerings; Design course; Design experience; Engineering graduate students; Graduate students; Oriented systems; Project oriented; System on chips design; Systems-on-Chip; Students,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85138306929

These rules are essentials as they help industrial designers to create high quality designs in an efficient way. [Problem] However, the management of an ever-increasing number of design rules becomes a real problem, especially for novice designers. Even if there exists some knowledge engineering tools for managing design rules, their capabilities are still limited and many companies continue to store their design rules in unstructured documents. Nowadays, the application of design rules remains a difficult task that needs a circular validation process between many experts in a manufacturing company. [Proposition] In this paper, we will analyze the main existing approaches for the application of design rules and we will demonstrate the need of a new approach to improve the current state-of-the-art practices. To minimize rule application impact on the design process, we propose to develop a Context-Aware Design Assistant that will recommend design rules on the fly while using computer-aided design software. Our design assistant relies on the modelling of the design rules and the design context in a single knowledge graph that can fuel a recommendation engine. [Future Work] In future work, we will describe the technical structure of the Context-Aware Design Assistant and develop it. The potential outcome of this research are: a better workflow integration of design rules application, a proactive verification of design solutions, a continuous learning of design rules and the detection and automation of design routines. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag France SAS, part of Springer Nature.",Cognitive assistant; Context awareness; Design rule; Knowledge graph; Lean design and interactive design; Product design,Application programs; Computer aided design; Knowledge graph; Lean production; Manufacture; Cognitive assistant; Context- awareness; Design designs; Design rules; Interactive design; Knowledge graphs; Lean design and interactive design; Lean designs; Manufacturing industries; Rule application; Product design,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85124068505

In particular, we see that most of the cloud-based applications and services often consist of hundreds of micro-services; however, the traditional monolithic pattern is no longer suitable for today’s development life-cycle. This is due to the difficulties of maintenance, scale, load balance, and many other factors associated with it. Consequently, people switch their focus on containerization—a lightweight virtualization technology. The saving grace is that it can use machine resources more efficiently than the virtual machine (VM). In VM, a guest OS is required to simulate on the host machine, whereas containerization enables applications to share a common OS. Furthermore, containerization facilitates users to create, delete, or deploy containers effortlessly. In order to manipulate and manage the multiple containers, the leading Cloud providers introduced the container orchestration platforms, such as Kubernetes, Docker Swarm, Nomad, and many others. In this paper, a rigorous study on Kubernetes from an administrator’s perspective is conducted. In a later stage, serverless computing paradigm was redefined and integrated with Kubernetes to accelerate the development of software applications. Theoretical knowledge and experimental evaluation show that this novel approach can be accommodated by the developers to design software architecture and development more efficiently and effectively by minimizing the cost charged by public cloud providers (such as AWS, GCP, Azure). However, serverless functions are attached with several issues, such as security threats, cold start problem, inadequacy of function debugging, and many other. Consequently, the challenge is to find ways to address these issues. However, there are difficulties and hardships in addressing all the issues altogether. Respectively, in this paper, we simply narrow down our analysis toward the security aspects of serverless. In particular, we quantitatively measure the success probability of attack in serverless (using Attack Tree and Attack–Defense Tree) with the possible attack scenarios and the related countermeasures. Thereafter, we show how the quantification can reflect toward the end-to-end security enhancement. In fine, this study concludes with research challenges such as the burdensome and error-prone steps of setting the platform, and investigating the existing security vulnerabilities of serverless computing, and possible future directions. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Attack tree; Container; Container orchestration; FaaS; Kubernetes; Security; Serverless computing,Application programs; Costs; Forestry; Life cycle; Network security; Software design; Virtual machine; Attack tree; Cloud providers; Container orchestration; Empirical research; Empirical studies; Faas; Kubernetes; Research challenges; Security; Serverless computing; Containers,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85123475646

Studying this phenomenon requires large amounts of resources and risk for operators and casing vendors alike. As Oil and Gas exploration and development moves into deeper waters and more challenging conditions, novel ways of design need to be adopted to keep costs low and maintain well integrity throughout the well life cycle. Different methods and concepts from vendors, operators, and engineering consultants in casing design for long term salt loading have been reviewed and analyzed. A common Casing design software was used to analyze the different methods through modelling and load analysis with the subsequent results compared. A reliability-based design approach incorporating deforming casing dimensions and failure probabilities is proposed. A decision-making flow chart is also developed to avoid over-designing and safely optimize casing design for an exploration keeper-well. Reducing uncertainty of uneven salt loading on production casing will pave the way for more fit-for-purpose well designs. By doing that, less material surplus is generated resulting in less waste and less emissions.

This practice is an iterative process of changing design variables until safety requirements for step and touch voltages and maximum ground grid resistance are met. It uses rectangular or square shape mesh arrangements. However, most of earthing systems in buildings, telecom towers are very complicated and not pure square or rectangular. Furthermore, IEEE process only allows to design grounding systems under uniform soil approximations. Since there are significant variations in the soil resistivity present at actual sites, multilayer soil model approach has been found to be much more accurate than the uniform soil model. This paper presents a mathematical model to analyze both simple and complicated grounding systems under uniform or non-uniform (multi-layered) soil structures.

These tools are essential for a reliable and efficient process and are widely taught in many engineering curricula. Recent developments in software and computing power enable near-real-time FE simulations that allow students to quickly explore different iterations of their designs. Material selection is another integral part of the product design cycle and should be considered in the design process, ideally alongside the modeling. Balancing objectives and constraints to find the material that best meets the design criteria requires both an understanding of the product's final application as well as materials science fundamentals. One challenge with combining materials selection and FE modeling is they are often taught separately, which can lead to one of the areas being underutilized during the design process. How do we as educators emphasize the importance of including materials selection during the simulation prototyping phase when both topics can be quite challenging for students? We in the Ansys Academic Development Team understand how critical it is to showcase the power of this combination to students during their undergraduate engineering and design degrees, so that they are prepared for their careers. Both simulation and materials selection benefit from real world examples within the classroom, allowing students to connect their previous understanding to the new topics being shown.

Design/methodology/approach: The Inventor CAD software was used to design the product experiment and perform the simulation by applying MoldFlow application to produce the processing parameter defining for the injection moulding machines. Findings: The results predicted by this filling simulation appears reasonable result as compared to the injected product. Prediction analysis given by the software is exceptionally valuable for the injection moulding parameter setting machines which can diminish the time of mould setup and can reduce the trial stage on the production line. Research limitations/implications: The gating system is the most crucial part in injection moulding process and the limitation is to get the accurate filling time and injection pressure to ensure the cavity is fully filled before the material at the gate solidify. Originality/value: Gating system configurations are utilized to optimize the filling conditions of injection moulding parts. This important element was developed for achieving product quality. The utilize of simulation software is exceptionally supportive in the model designing stage to predict the quality and process capacity for the product.

Herein, a novel fluorescence sensor integrating power source, light source, filter, sample cell and smartphone was constructed. The model of fluorescence sensor was designed by using Autodesk Computer Aided Design (CAD) software, and printed with 3D printing technology, followed by assembling with various components. With advantages of convenient carrying, good stability, wide applicability and low cost, the fluorescence sensor showed great adaptability for on-site visual detection. Nitrite was chosen as the model of analyte, and ratiometric fluorescent probe (B/R-CDs) was employed as the identification and signal element for detecting nitrite. With the increase of nitrite concentration, the fluorescence intensity of B/R-CDs at 460 nm decreased, while that at 615 nm kept stable. Therefore, the fluorescence color of B/R-CDs changed from blue to red. By using the portable sensor to collect RGB value of fluorescence color, the R/B channel values showed a linear relationship with nitrite concentration in 2.5–600 µM, with detection limit of 0.8 µM. Then the fluorescence sensor was used to detect nitrite in preserved meat and pickles, and recovery rate was among 94.0%−105%. The detection results were consistent with those of fluorescence method and spectrophotometry. This work provides a novel detection device for on-site analysis, and also offers an effective approach for developing miniature fluorescence sensors. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Fluorescence sensor; On-site detection; Portability; Visualization,3D printers; Computer aided design; Costs; Fluorescence; Filter sample; Fluorescence sensors; Low-costs; On-site detection; Portability; Power sources; Sample cell; Smart phones; Source filters; Visual detection; Light sources,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85139311923

The effects of these loading forces in health and disease are of interest to biologists, but the availability of affordable equipment for in vitro experimentation is an obstacle to research progress. Here, we report the development of a cost-effective hydropneumatic bioreactor system for research in mechanobiology. The bioreactor was assembled from readily available components (a closed-loop stepped motor and pneumatic actuator) and a minimal number of easily-machined crankshaft parts, whilst the cell culture chambers were custom designed by the biologists using CAD and entirely 3 D printed in PLA. The bioreactor system was shown to be capable of providing cyclic pulsed pressure waves at a user-defined amplitude and frequency ranging from 0 to 400 kPa and up to 3.5 Hz, which are physiologically relevant for cartilage. Tissue engineered cartilage was created from primary human chondrocytes and cultured in the bioreactor for five days with three hours/day cyclic pressure (300 kPa at 1 Hz), simulating moderate physical exercise. Bioreactor-stimulated chondrocytes significantly increased their metabolic activity (by 21%) and glycosaminoglycan synthesis (by 24%), demonstrating effective cellular transduction of mechanosensing. Our Open Design approach focused on using ‘off-the-shelf’ pneumatic hardware and connectors, open source software and in-house 3 D printing of bespoke cell culture containers to resolve long-standing problems in the availability of affordable bioreactors for laboratory research. © 2022 The Author(s).

Excessive water production is a well-known problem faced by petroleum industry, combine with carbonate reservoirs that are notoriously difficult to characterize and challenging to produce, the selection of suitable WSO method is vital to ensure successful and sustainable treatment. However, limited studies have been conducted to compare between various chemical WSO from the industry guidelines with the success rate and lesson learned from historical field execution particularly for carbonate gas reservoirs in Malaysia. Carbonate gas reservoirs have long been an important element of Malaysia's O&G business and as the portfolio increases to meet regional energy demand, focus on effective WSO treatment for carbonate gas wells is crucial in ensuring continuous production delivery to the customers. As a result, study was initiated to evaluate feasibility of WSO using calcium carbonate polymer in a carbonate gas field that has been producing for almost 25 years with nonuniform strong aquifer support and experiencing excessive water production. The workflow adopted for the WSO treatment involves thorough reservoir review to ascertain the water production caused, extensive laboratory testing that include core flood experiments to ascertain the chemical effectiveness, detail field historical production data analysis performance analysis (e.g. nodal analysis and network modeling), sensitivity analysis on fluid placement using CAD software (e.g. StimPro), economic evaluation that include decision risk analysis to evaluate all range of probabilistic outcome along with a structured post-job review on the failure analysis. Laboratory testing and core flooding was conducted to mimic the condition during mixing at surface, pumping into the well and the soaking in the reservoir, from 80degf at 14.7psi and to 245degF up at 1700psi. Building the model for WSO candidates requires well calibration and matching to the current well performance to ensure correct basis of evaluation, hence Prosper was used as a tool for nodal analysis for multilayer model to analyze the zone contribution, estimate the gas production gain and determine water production reduction. Chemical placement and volume were generated using StimPro considering several case scenarios that include coiled tubing placement, optimum injection rate and ideal penetration depth. Based on the laboratory test results, the calcium carbonate polymer can be pump through the CT (e.g. total gelling time of 48hrs including mixing, POOH CT & soaking). Core flooding indicate that it can be pumped into the reservoir & withstand up to 1700 psi forward pressure. Fluid placement was generated using StimPro where it was recommended to use retrievable packer to minimize the risk of calcium carbonate polymer invasion into the gas producing zone. Post-job review suggests additional test to mimic all possible scenarios on-site particularly temperature sensitivity to determine gelling time and gel stability correspond to various pumping time and rates. This paper highlighted the potential of WSO using calcium carbonate polymer for the candidate well and will be applicable as evident of practical improvement for the WSO treatment execution in the future. Change in business landscapes may be observed toward chemical WSO should the application is successful to maximize Asset value within PETRONAS that experiencing similar issue.

The aim of this study was to create multilayered scaffolds mimicking the architectural fiber characteristics of human heart valve leaflets using conductive 3D-printed collectors. Models of aortic valve cusps were created using commercial computer-aided design (CAD) software. Conductive polylactic acid was used to fabricate 3D-printed leaflet templates. These cusp negatives were integrated into a specifically designed, rotating electrospinning mandrel. Three layers of polyurethane were spun onto the collector, mimicking the fiber orientation of human heart valves. Surface and fiber structure was assessed with a scanning electron microscope (SEM). The application of fluorescent dye additionally permitted the microscopic visualization of the multilayered fiber structure. Tensile testing was performed to assess the biomechanical properties of the scaffolds. 3D-printing of essential parts for the electrospinning rig was possible in a short time for a low budget. The aortic valve cusps created following this protocol were three-layered, with a fiber diameter of 4.1 ± 1.6 µm. SEM imaging revealed an even distribution of fibers. Fluorescence microscopy revealed individual layers with differently aligned fibers, with each layer precisely reaching the desired fiber configuration. The produced scaffolds showed high tensile strength, especially along the direction of alignment. The printing files for the different collectors are available as Supplemental File 1, Supplemental File 2, Supplemental File 3, Supplemental File 4, and Supplemental File 5. With a highly specialized setup and workflow protocol, it is possible to mimic tissues with complex fiber structures over multiple layers. Spinning directly on 3D-printed collectors creates considerable flexibility in manufacturing 3D shapes at low production costs. © 2022, Journal of Visualized Experiments.

For assembly operations, which are usually done by special machines or human operators, a multirobot cell gives a more flexible solution. Robots trajectories are generated using a CAD model of the cell with an offline programming software. The drawback when using offline programming is the difference between the real trajectories of robots and the theoretical ones. In this paper, a method to calibrate multirobot cell is proposed. This calibration consist in identifying the real positions and orientations of each robot frame with respect to the other. This operation allows to improve the accuracy of the robotic cell by reducing the gap between the CAD model and the physical cell. The calibration is carried out by using a laser profiler and a reference sphere. © 2022 IEEE.",assembly; calibration; industry; multirobot; offline programming; robot,Assembly; Cells; Computer aided design; Cytology; Industrial robots; Robot programming; Assembly cells; Assembly operations; CAD models; Calibration methodologies; Human operator; Machine operators; Multirobots; Off line programming; Production line; Special machine; Calibration,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85143908396

Moreover, it is seen as an important step towards the computerintegrated manufacturing (CIM) environment. On the other hand, the evaluation process of CAD software packages is a multiple-criteria decision-making (MCDM) problem in the presence of sets of alternatives and evaluation criteria, which should be solved using one of the MCDM methods in the current literature. Therefore, in this study, the analytic hierarchy process (AHP), successfully implemented in both academic research and practices, is used for CAD software selection problem. The method is also used with the group decision-making approach to reach a more reliable solution. Additionally, due to the fact that the crisp pairwise comparison in the traditional AHP method seems to be insufficient and imprecise to capture the right judgments of decision makers (DMs), the hesitant fuzzy linguistic term-sets are integrated with the AHP approach (the hesitant F-AHP) to model the vagueness and uncertainty on judgments of the DMs. This proposed approach is also supported with a user-friendly Excel template that provides an effective tool for companies to evaluate and rank CAD software packages without many tiresome fuzzy comparisons and complex calculations. Moreover, in the paper, a numerical example is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and applicability of the proposed approach to potential readers and practitioners.

The approach of dividing competence and responsibility in complex software development by introducing an additional domain-specific layer of interaction between the software developer and the subject area specialists is discussed. The use of an adaptive modelling system as a tool for such separation is proposed. It is shown that the use of adaptive modelling as a common development platform for industry-specific CAD will not only improve the quality of production design in different industries, but will also simplify the design of production in related fields.

Specifically, in the field of autologous auricular reconstruction, i.e. the reconstruction of the external ear using the patient's costal cartilage, the authors worked towards the development of new patient-specific intraoperative devices, to support the surgeon during the procedure. The surgical guide design was then supported by the development of automated techniques for their modelling. In this work, a new hybrid technique for the CAD modelling of surgical guides is proposed. The idea is not to totally eliminate the intervention of the physician in defining the shape of the surgical guides, but rather to simplify their interaction with design tools. The proposed method is based on the straightforward adaption of a two-dimensional template developed by evaluating various auricular biometric parameters to approximate ear structure. The template is coupled to a parametric automatic procedure that generates the surgical guides' CAD model. The template was created outside of commercial CAD modeling software packages to make the procedure more accessible, and it is managed using a well-designed graphical user interface. With specialized questionnaires to evaluate the surgeon's satisfaction, the interface was put to the test, and the results were positive. © 2023 CAD Solutions, LLC,.",3D Modelling; Autologous Ear Reconstruction; CAD; Microtia; Personalized Medicine; Reverse Engineering,3D modeling; Computer aided design; Image reconstruction; Restoration; Reverse engineering; Surgery; Surveys; Three dimensional computer graphics; 3D models; 3d-modeling; Autologous ear reconstruction; CAD modeling; Interactive tool; Medical fields; Microtium; Personalized medicines; Rapid-prototyping; Simple++; Graphical user interfaces,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85134168415

Integrating different technologies and materials into one operational procedure can produce 3D tissue engineering scaffolds with enhanced properties. There are different tissue engineering strategies, including cell-based, factor-based, and scaffold-based strategies. In scaffold-based tissue engineering, 3D scaffolds are one of the most important applications of 3D printers, especially in medical science.

Docking and molecular dynamics simulations, key representatives of the structure-based approaches, provide detailed information about the potential interaction of a ligand with a target receptor. However, at the same time, they require a three-dimensional structure of a protein and a relatively high amount of computational resources. Nowadays, as both docking and molecular dynamics are much more extensively used, the amount of data output from these procedures is also growing. Therefore, there are also more and more approaches that facilitate the analysis and interpretation of the results of structure-based tools. In this review, we will comprehensively summarize approaches for handling molecular dynamics simulations output. It will cover both statistical and machine-learning-based tools, as well as various forms of depiction of molecular dynamics output.

Energy consumption is a critical aspect of these devices, being heavily impacted by how programs are developed, and it becomes more evident in interpreted languages that naturally demand more resources. Commonly embedded software development uses Time-triggered (TT) and Event-triggered (ET) architectures to design embedded projects. However, the TT strategy can consume more energy due to the polling method; in contrast, the ET approach can be energy-efficient but cannot deal with multiple events. This paper introduces JSEVAsync, a framework to help developers to design applications using JavaScript language for IoT devices that combine the best parts of TT and ET architectures. This approach uses JavaScript's non-blocking concept as a development interface to structure the algorithms into asynchronous events. To validate it, we compare C- and JavaScript-based applications and analyze the results from the energy consumption perspective. We found that writing code through JSEVAsync can be up to 21% more energy efficient than the traditional method. Moreover, JavaScript can improve design-time aspects such as readability, maintainability, and code reuse.  © 2022 IEEE.",Embedded Software; Energy Saving; Internet of Things; JavaScript,C (programming language); Embedded software; Embedded systems; Energy efficiency; Internet of things; Software design; Asynchronous event; Energy  savings; Energy efficient; Energy-consumption; Energy-savings; Event-based; Event-triggered; Javascript; Time event; Time triggered; Energy utilization,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85143833112

A Runtime Environment (RTE) is essential for any AUTOSAR software architecture. The information to conFigure the Runtime Environment (RTE), for any embedded Electronic Control Unit (ECU) design, is given in an AUTOSAR Extensible Markup Language (ARXML) file. Currently, these ARXML files are interpreted by the developer to manually create each configuration. That is a huge bottleneck in the design flow of software because of the drawbacks such as the cost and time spent having to manually write code. Also, manual code entry is not scalable for larger projects. Every time manual code is created it needs to be tested and verified to ensure ISO 26262 compliance. Creating an ISO 26262 compliant, RTE code generator is essential in the process of automating integration of AUTOSAR methodology in the design of ECUs.

Among them, parametric design is widely used in the field of construction. In order to promote the development of building structured cabling industry, this paper will use data mining technology to study the parametric design method of SCS. This paper puts forward the method of secondary development and design software through the research of building SCS, and uses data mining technology to carry out parametric design of building SCS. Then, the feasibility of the design is tested by comparing the data of the traditional design and the parametric design.

The impact of buildings and cities on the environment is crucial and unmistakable. It should be emphasized that an inappropriately (architecturally or technologically) designed building with state-of-the-art control technology will still have worse properties than an optimally designed building without a control system. This inspired us to design a building energy model (BEM) with the implementation of a Smart Grid in a decentralized sustainable energy system, which is a microgrid from renewable energy sources (RES). This inspired us to conduct an analysis of simulation models (simultaneous simulations) to show the possibility of their application in the process of fully satisfying energy needs in a given urban region. The main goal is to design an original methodology for the design of smart “Nearly Zero Energy Buildings” (NZEB) and subsequent energy sustainability solutions. This led us to use Hybrid Optimization of Multiple Energy Resources (HOMER), PV*SOL (2D solar software design tool for the photovoltaic system performance), Monte Carlo and DesignBuilder. The EMB was designed based on the Six Sigma design quality management methodology. In the process of integrating Smart Grids with energy efficiency solutions for buildings, an original optimization basis was designed for smart buildings and smart urban areas.

Applied digital workflow in dentistry embraces data acquisition with intraoral scanning, object design in CAD software and 3D printing with corresponding materials on adequate 3D printer. With the utilization of the 3D techniques, it is possible to make adequate digital models and to reproduce them with enough precision, which led to a transformation in dentistry practice and a wide range of present and possible future applications.

It can be obtained by reducing induced pressure drop or by increasing compactness and heat transfer efficiency. The HX designers always tend to develop a new architecture with thermal enhancement tools. In this context, Additive manufacturing (AM) offers the opportunity to reach new performances and integrations through the development of innovation geometries of HX. For the last 10 years, AM was explored producing compact and efficient thermal components. This has led to the improving the process and the ability to manufacture complex and very thin structures. In parallel, new design software and new design methodologies have been developed such as generative design or implicit CAD modeler. This imposes the development of new innovative heat transfer intensification structures based on local heat transfer and CFD analysis. A dedicated analysis was focused on the surface roughness impact. The generated roughness with AM can be substantially larger than with conventional manufacturing process. Moreover, wall roughness varies according to their orientation based on the main direction of printing. This parameter was taken into consideration during fins optimization in both experimental or numerical work.

This technology speeds up the production, rendering, and grading of patterns as well as the digitization and storage of hard-copy patterns [2]. It also replaces traditional design. On the other hand, because it is possible to graphically portray the developed garment without the necessity for a prototype, three-dimensional (3D) representation of the developed CAD design through digital visualization encourages quicker evaluation of the product's fit performance. However, one area that requires research is how to apply these technologies to create a digital twin of the country's significant and historical national costume, which is essential to be preserved digitally because it represents the nation's culture and disposition.By creating a digital twin of the terno dress worn during the 1940s, this study verified the efficacy of digital technology IR 4.0 in the conservation of Philippine National Wear. The virtual fit validation of the digitized terno dress confirms that the generated digital pattern fits closely on the avatar's body on the bust, waist, arms, and hips, as evidenced by the garment fit map of the constructed digital prototype. In fact 100% of the respondents concurred that the silhouette of the traditional terno dress was replicated using the digitalization process. However, only 50% of respondents gave the garment a 5 for fit because as they undertook their basic duties, such as sitting or moving their hands, the shoulder area of the dress began to flare up, causing them some little discomfort. But overall findings indicated that respondents were satisfied. Thus, the digitization technique used in the study could reproduce the traditional terno dress. As a result, it can be concluded that digital prototyping employing computer-aided engineering tools can successfully reengineer national traditional wear. © 2022 IEEE.",computer aided engineering; pattern digitalization; pattern digitization; terno dress; virtual garment,Computer aided design; Computer aided engineering; Digital devices; Grading; Three dimensional computer graphics; CAD softwares; Computer-aided engineering; Digital patterns; Digitisation; Hard copies; Pattern digitalization; Pattern digitization; Speed up; Terno dress; Virtual garments; Product design,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85159460762

The elementary hardware digital processing units, used to solve the inverse kinetics equations, have been implemented inside the Programming Logic (PL) part of the Zynq platform. Other secondary tasks, such as communication with the host PC, data storage and display have been devoted to the software application running on the Processing System (PS) part. A dedicated Graphical User Interface (GUI) has been also developed on a remote host computer. This application will be essentially used to handle the communication with the embedded reactivity measurement system and to display the reactivity evolution curves through the time. The design has been validated by comparing the obtained results with those proposed in the literature. Real plant data, acquired from Es-salam research reactor, has been also used to confirm the online efficiency of the design.

Concurrently, the event-based motion simulation (EBMS) procedure was carried out on the CAD model. The concept of the operational strategy of the test platform was clarified through the machine's real-life experience before being constructed in vitro. The platform model is capable of reproducing two active movements to simulate the locomotion of the thigh angle and hip vertical displacement for assessing the artificial knee angle motion during the gait cycle. These motions were controlled by two rotary forces (motors) that are utilized to implement control actions in EBMS. The prosthetic knee joint was built with a single axis that performs flexion and extension via the axial force of the spring. The simulation results of the thigh angle motion ranged from 20° 2 to - 15°, while the maximum flexion of the prosthetic knee joint was (46°). The mean absolute error was (2.727°) and (8.338°) for the thigh and knee joints, respectively.

If models are to be the primary information carriers during development, the applied methods to enable interaction between engineering domains need to be modular, reusable, and scalable. Given the long life cycles and often large and heterogeneous development organizations in the aircraft industry, a piece to the overall solution could be to rely on open standards and tools. In this paper, the standards Functional Mock-up Interface (FMI) and System Structure and Parameterization (SSP) are exploited to exchange data between the disciplines of systems simulation and geometry modeling. A method to export data from the 3D Computer Aided Design (CAD) Software (SW) CATIA in the SSP format is developed and presented. Analogously, FMI support of the Modeling & Simulation (M&S) tools OMSimulator, OpenModelica, and Dymola is utilized along with the SSP support of OMSimulator. The developed technology is put into context by means of integration with the M&S methodology for aircraft vehicle system development deployed at Saab Aeronautics. Finally, the established interoperability is demonstrated on two different industrially relevant application examples addressing varying aspects of complexity.

For this purpose, they often refer to online resources, which are easy to access and contain a wealth of information in various formats. Programming screencasts hosted on platforms such as YouTube are one such online resource that has seen a growth in popularity and adoption over the past decade. These screencasts usually have some metadata such as a title, a short description, and a set of tags that should describe what the main concepts captured in the video are. Unfortunately, metadata are often generic and do not contain detailed information about the code showcased in the tutorial, such as the API calls or graphical user interface (GUI) elements employed, which could lead to developers missing useful tutorials. Having a quick overview of the main code elements and GUIs used in a video tutorial can be very helpful for developers looking for code examples involving specific API calls, or looking to design applications with a specific GUI in mind.

VID2META is currently designed to work with Android screencasts. It analyzes video frames using a combination of computer vision, deep learning, optical character recognition, and heuristic-based approaches to identify the needed information in a frame, extract it, and present it to the developer.

To overcome the limitations of conventional strategies – invasive surgeries and bone loss around the implant-, new approaches, namely the development of CAD/CAM customized implants, are emerging as promising solutions for replacing missing teeth, thus avoiding destruction of bone by drilling it. Despite the efforts that are being carried out, the designing, including image acquisition, and manufacturing efficacy of such rehabilitation therapy is not easily found in the literature. In this sense, this research work aimed to assess the errors associated with the image acquisition, treatment and manufacturing of Customized Root-Analogue Implants (CRAI). The experimental procedure, carried out in a dog cadaveric mandible, encompassed the image acquisition and treatment and the subsequent manufacturing of four different CRAI. Two Image acquisition methods (CBCT and X-ray), and different software for their treatment were used, and the final CRAI were manufactured by Computer Numerical Control. Results revealed the CBCT scan allowed to properly visualize the original teeth contours. However, all the obtained teeth geometries presented smaller surface areas when compared to the original teeth indicating however a systematic predictable error. On the other hand, when comparing the surface area of the digital and the manufactured teeth, very small differences were observed, which indicates that the CNC manufacturing technique is a promising solution for such applications. When placing the produced CRAI in the dog mandible it was possible to observe a lack of congruency between the CRAI and bone, mainly due to image acquisition process errors and the destruction of the periodontal ligament during the soft tissues removal process. Thus, CBCT images seem to be a feasible route to design root-analogue implants, and, if needed, a compensation strategy for the systematic image acquisition error may be implemented. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd",CAD/CAM; Cone-beam computed tomography; Customized root-analogue implant (CRAI); Zirconia,Animals; Cadaver; Computer-Aided Design; Dental Implants; Dogs; Humans; Mandible; Technology; Computer aided design; Computerized tomography; Image acquisition; Industrial research; Manufacture; Zirconia; Bone loss; Cad/cams; Cone-beam computed tomography; Customized root-analog implant; Dog mandible; Global market; Invasive surgery; Manufacturing technologies; Surface area; Treatment technologies; analytical error; Article; computer aided design/computer aided manufacturing; cone beam computed tomography; dog; experimental study; geometry; image analysis; image quality; image segmentation; jaw radiography; mandible; nonhuman; periodontal ligament; soft tissue; surface area; technology; animal; cadaver; computer aided design; diagnostic imaging; human; mandible; surgery; tooth implant; Numerical methods,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85133189520

The aspects of modularity and scalability in system design are outlined. Further, a market study of existing battery systems for satellites was analysed to compare the specifications and functionality. The fundamental building block of the presented battery system is a cell module that consists of eight battery cells. By stacking multiple battery modules either the electrical capacity and current capability or the terminal voltage can be adapted to the satellite's requirements. This modular approach also makes the battery system redundant. The software is also responsible for communication between battery modules and analysis of the state of the battery cells with sensors for temperature, current and voltage of each cell. The COTS battery system is developed to reduce manufacturing price and increase functionality of future satellites. Development and testing of the battery system are supported by the fundamental knowledge of batteries at the DLR's Institute of Engineering Thermodynamics. The approach of using mostly COTS components including the battery cells influences system architecture, electronic design, software and the qualification process. The battery system has the ability to measure temperature, voltage and current of each battery cell. This allows for further functions like adaptive cell balancing, state of charge and state of health estimation. The goal of a highly functional battery system is to give the operator knowledge of the remaining useful life of the satellite. © 2022 International Astronautical Federation, IAF.

Its main advantage is the fast approximation of the aerodynamics of spacecraft in the lower end of the low-Earth orbit altitude range. It is a novel implementation of a panel method, where the body is represented as a set of fundamental elements and the sum of their individual aerodynamic properties makes up the properties of the whole. ADBSat's approach treats the shape as a set of flat triangular plates. These are read from a CAD geometry file in the Wavefront format, which can be created with most common CAD programs. A choice of gas-surface interaction models is available to represent the physics of free-molecular flow under different conditions. Its modular design means that other models can be easily and quickly implemented. It also benefits from a new shading algorithm for fast determination of elemental flow exposure. An example case is presented to show the capability and functionality of the program.

Solution method: A new implementation of the panel method has been devised. The satellite shape is passed to the program as a CAD model, comprised of a set of flat triangular plates. ADBSat then calculates the aerodynamic characteristics of each element using an appropriate mathematical model, and sums the contributions for the overall properties of the body. A novel shading algorithm identifies and removes the panels which do not contribute to the calculations due to being protected from the flow by other body features. ADBSat also has the capability to account for different materials within the shape.

This paper describes the experimental and simulation verification of a 1.3 litre water cooled engine lubrication system. The lubrication circuit model is built in Ricardo Ignite software. The simulation model preparation steps using 3D-CAD model is explained in paper. Engine main bearing and connecting big-end bearing leakage maps are evaluated using Ricardo Valdyn software which is capable of simulation engine crank-train multi body dynamics along with bearing oil behavior. The pressure and flow distribution at various locations are predicted using simulation model. These simulation predictions are experimentally verified. It is observed acceptable correlation between simulation and experimental values. The same calibrated model is used for a case study where engine main oil gallery pressure for lower speed range is improved. Various options are studied for avoiding major modification in lubrication circuit mode. It is found that pipe attaching main oil gallery and gear-train uses benzo. The optimum benzo internal diameter is optimized and observed ~ 0.5 bar main oil gallery pressure improvement in low speed rages. The simulation model is verified experimentally and observed promising correlation. The intention of this work is to check feasibility of this technique for establishing good confidence and expertise in lubrication system developments. © 2022 SAE International.

Modern lattice-based cryptographic schemes have proven to be a good alternative, both to face the security threats that arise as a consequence of the development of quantum computing and to allow efficient implementations of cryptographic primitives in resource-limited embedded systems, such as those used in consumer and industrial applications of the IoT. This article describes the hardware implementation of parameterized multi-unit serial polynomial multipliers to speed up time-consuming operations in NTRU-based cryptographic schemes. The flexibility in selecting the design parameters and the interconnection protocol with a general-purpose processor allow them to be applied both to the standardized variants of NTRU and to the new proposals that are being considered in the post-quantum contest currently held by the National Institute of Standards and Technology, as well as to obtain an adequate cost/performance/security-level trade-off for a target application. The designs are provided as AXI4 bus-compliant intellectual property modules that can be easily incorporated into embedded systems developed with the Vivado design tools. The work provides an extensive set of implementation and characterization results in devices of the Xilinx Zynq-7000 and Zynq UltraScale+ families for the different sets of parameters defined in the NTRUEncrypt standard. It also includes details of their plug and play inclusion as hardware accelerators in the C implementation of this public-key encryption scheme codified in the LibNTRU library, showing that acceleration factors of up to 3.1 are achieved when compared to pure software implementations running on the processing systems included in the programmable devices. © 2022 by the authors.

The notion of CPS is linked to concepts of robotics and sensor networks with intelligent systems proper of computational intelligence leading the pathway. Recent advances in science and engineering improve the link between computational and physical elements by means of intelligent systems, increasing the adaptability, autonomy, efficiency, functionality, reliability, safety, and usability of cyber-physical systems.

These approaches have a huge potential for reducing computational costs in the simulation of electronic circuits and in the CAD systems for electronics. Simulation of modern radio-frequency (RF) circuits, especially for RF integrated circuits, is one of the areas of extensive scientific research and development. The main problem of analysis methods for circuit design of RF electronics is the significant computational costs associated with the high dimensions to be solved. This paper shows that the computational costs of circuit design are largely determined by the costs of solving a system of linear algebraic equations (SLAE). The problems of the solving of SLAE are indicated in the paper. Further development of methods for solving and reducing computational costs requires the use of new approaches, one of which is proposed in this paper. The article presents the developed algorithm for converting a second-order matrix into a higher-order tensor.

The proposed procedure faces the challenge of using few mechanical and geometrical parameters of individual buildings belonging to an existing masonry aggregate as the input of a proper vulnerability algorithm based on the direct interaction between the programming software MATLAB and the structural analysis and design software POR2000. In this way, all possible combinations of the input parameters can be taken into account and a large set of numerical models is generated and analysed by nonlinear static analyses. The output of the procedure is represented by the bilinear capacity curves of the equivalent single degree of freedom models and by the values of the capacity/demand ratios. The entire approach has been firstly accurately defined and after applied on the pilot case study of the historical centre of the municipality of Foggia, Puglia, Southern Italy.

The finite element models can somehow be used as a mathematical model but due to complex shape/structure of the component, the size of discrete models resulting from finite element analysis is usually very large, causing the virtual simulation to be extremely computationally intensive and time consuming, also the boundary conditions applied are not very scalable, making the system deviate from its real dynamic behavior. Thus, this paper deals with the design of a Model Order Reduction technique, using orthogonal decomposition of system matrices, which can be used for creating accurate low-order dynamic model with scalable boundary conditions. The technique works in 3 phases namely, extraction of system matrices from software tools (such as ANSYS), Development of a second order reduced model using object-oriented programming language (such as MATLAB), and Deployment of model in form of state space matrices for model-based Design software (such as Simulink) This paper presents two case studies, first one done for a simplistic beam structure (cantilever) where the model is reduced using the MOR technique and the results (accelerations/displacements and mode frequencies) are validated with experimental and theoretical results.

The purpose of this work is to find ways to determine the sensitivity based on the bionspired theory. The scientific novelty lies in the development of a hybrid genetic algorithm for bionspirated automated sensitivity determination. The statement of the problem in this work is as follows: to optimize the determination of the sensitivity by using a hybrid GA. A fundamental difference from the known approaches in the use of new modified genetic structures in bionspirated computer-aided design, in addition, a new method for determining the sensitivity, based on a hybrid GA, is presented in the work. Thus, the problem of creating methods, algorithms and software for automated determination of sensitivity is currently of particular relevance.

Fixture design, which affects the part-quality in terms of geometric accuracy and surface finish, can be enhanced by using the product manufacturing information (PMI) stored in the neutral standard for the exchange of product model data (STEP) file, thereby integrating design and manufacturing. The present paper proposes a unique fixture design approach, to extract the geometry information from STEP application protocol (AP) 242 files of computer aided design (CAD) models, for providing automatic suggestions of locator positions and clamping surfaces. Automatic feature extraction software “FiXplan”, developed using the programming language C#, is used to extract the part feature, dimension and geometry information. The information from the STEP AP242 file is deduced using geometric reasoning techniques, which in turn is utilized for fixture planning. The developed software is observed to be adept in identifying the primary, secondary, and tertiary locating faces and locator position configurations of prismatic components. Structural analysis of the prismatic part under different locator positions was performed using commercial finite element method software, ABAQUS, and the optimized locator position was identified on the basis of minimum deformation of the workpiece. The area-ratio (base locator enclosed area (%)/work piece base area (%)) for the ideal locator configuration was observed as 33%. Experiments were conducted on a prismatic workpiece using a specially designed fixture, for different locator configurations. The surface roughness and waviness of the machined surfaces were analysed using an Alicona non-contact optical profilometer. The best surface characteristics were obtained for the surface machined under the ideal locator positions having an area-ratio of 33%, thus validating the predicted numerical results. The efficiency, capability and applicability of the developed software is demonstrated for the finishing operation of a sensor cover — a typical prismatic component having applications in the naval industry, under different locator configurations. The best results were obtained under the proposed ideal locator configuration of area-ratio 33%. © 2021, Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",3D surface roughness; automation; computer aided design (CAD)/computer aided manufacturing (CAM); computer integrated manufacturing; computer-aided fixture design; product manufacturing information; Standard for the exchange of product model data (STEP) application protocol (AP) 242,3D modeling; ABAQUS; Application programs; Fixtures (tooling); Geometry; Manufacture; Product design; Surface roughness; Three dimensional computer graphics; Application protocols; Automatic feature extraction; Commercial finite element method software; Computer aided design models; Manufacturing activities; Product manufacturing; Standard for the exchange of product model data; Surface characteristics; Computer aided design,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85102240476

A large number of software with varying level of scope and applicability is currently available to facilitate the task. However, possession of an optical design software, per se, is no guarantee for arriving at correct or optimal solutions. The validity and/or optimality of the solutions depend to a large extent on proper formulation of the problem, which calls for correct application of principles and theories of optical engineering. On a different note, development of proper experimental setups for investigations in the burgeoning field of optics and photonics calls for a good understanding of these principles and theories. With this backdrop in view, this book presents a holistic treatment of topics like paraxial analysis, aberration theory, Hamiltonian optics, ray-optical and wave-optical theories of image formation, Fourier optics, structural design, lens design optimization, global optimization etc. Proper stress is given on exposition of the foundations. The proposed book is designed to provide adequate material for ‘self-learning’ the subject. For practitioners in related fields, this book is a handy reference. Foundations of Optical System Analysis and Synthesis provides • A holistic approach to lens system analysis and design with stress on foundations • Basic knowledge of ray and wave optics for tackling problems of instrumental optics • Proper explanation of approximations made at different stages • Sufficient illustrations for facilitation of understanding • Techniques for reducing the role of heuristics and empiricism in optical/lens design • A sourcebook on chronological development of related topics across the globe This book is composed as a reference book for graduate students, researchers, faculty, scientists and technologists in R and D centres and industry, in pursuance of their understanding of related topics and concepts during problem solving in the broad areas of optical, electro-optical and photonic system analysis and design. © 2022 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,,Book,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85133690593

One of the sectors with the greatest benefits due to this type of energy has been the rural sector, where several small power plants with a generating capacity between 500KW and 1MW have been installed, which are usually Pelton turbines. In the present research it is necessary to use reverse engineering followed by a numerical study to performance of small Pelton turbines due to the fact that geometry dimensions have not been provided. For this purpose, the geometry has been obtained by applying reverse engineering using a technique based on the solidification of polymers. A silicon elastomer is spread over the buckets to obtain a rubber-type shell and it is then cover with plaster to maintain the shape of the rubber. A 3D scanner is used to obtain a cloud of points which is then processed to generate a faceted surface model. The three-dimensional model is edited and improved using CAD software. A basic simulation is presented to show that this reverse engineering process can be used to perform numerical analysis of Pelton turbines. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,Computer aided design; Environmental impact; Hydraulic machinery; Hydraulic motors; Hydroelectric power plants; Reverse engineering; Rubber; Silicon rubber; Turbines; Faceted surfaces; Generating capacity; High-efficiency; Hydroelectric plant; Pelton turbines; Reverse engineering process; Silicon elastomers; Three-dimensional model; Small power plants,Conference paper,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85108605764

In this paper we study the effect of two assessment strategies in an educational context: One based on penalisation, the other based on rewards. Both are applied to assignments where the students develop a project focusing on keeping a low technical debt level, and obtaining a high quality code. We describe the design, tools and context of the strategies applied. SonarQube, a tool commonly used in production environments, is used for measuring the metrics. The penalisation strategy is based on a SonarQube quality gate. The reward strategy is based on a contest, where an automatic judge tool is devised to provide an online leaderboard with a classification based on the SonarQube metrics. An empirical study is conducted to determine which of the strategies works better to help the students/trainees keep the Technical Debt low. Statistically significant results are obtained in 5 of the 8 analysed metrics, showing that the reward strategy works much better. The effect size of the executed statistical tests is analysed, resulting in medium and large effect size in the majority of the analysed metrics.  © 2021 IEEE.",Empirical Study; Software Development; Teaching and Training Technical Debt Topics; Technical Debt,Software engineering; Assessment strategies; Educational context; Empirical studies; Management IS; Production environments; Quality gates; Software engineering students; Technical debts; Students,Conference paper,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85114775451

However, DfX methodologies are undergoing the lack of real integration with 3D CAD systems. Their principles are currently applied downstream of the 3D modelling by following the well-known rules available from the literature and engineers’ know-how (tacit internal knowledge). This paper provides a method to formalize complex DfX engineering knowledge into explicit knowledge that can be reused for Advanced Engineering Informatics to aid designers and engineers in developing mechanical products. This research work wants to define a general method (ontology) able to couple DfX design guidelines (engineering knowledge) with geometrical product features of a product 3D model (engineering parametric data). A common layer for all DfX methods (horizontal) and dedicated layers for each DfX method (vertical) allow creating the suitable ontology for the systematic collection of the DfX rules considering each target. Moreover, the proposed framework is the first step for developing (future work) a software tool to assist engineers and designers during product development (3D CAD modelling). A design for assembly (DfA) case study shows how to collect assembly rules in the given framework. It demonstrates the applicability of the CAD-integrated DfX system in the mechanical design of a jig-crane.

To address this important issue, a general multibody approach is employed in this paper to develop a reciprocating mechanism suitable for retrofitting the existing manual mechanical ventilators through computer-aided engineering tools. By analyzing various basic articulated mechanisms typically found in engineering mechanics, a prototype is created and reproduced in a threedimensional environment using SOLIDWORKS's CAD software. Subsequently, a high-fidelity mechanical model is developed starting from the CAD geometry and employing the SIMSCAPE MULTIBODY software, an extension of the MATLAB family of programs that can effectively and efficiently perform kinematic and dynamic simulations of the mechanism of interest.

Thus, to achieve a successful transformation to Industry 4.0 standard, manufacturing enterprises are required to implement a clear roadmap. However, Small and Medium Manufacturing Enterprises (SMEs) encounter many barriers and difficulties (economical, technical, cultural, etc.) in the implementation of Industry 4.0. Although several works deal with the incorporation of Industry 4.0 technologies in the area of the product and supply chain life cycles, which SMEs could use as reference, this is not the case for the customer life cycle. Thus, we present two contributions that can help the software engineers of those SMEs to incorporate Industry 4.0 technologies in the context of the customer life cycle. The first contribution is a methodology that can help those software engineers in the task of creating new software services, aligned with Industry 4.0, that allow to change how customers interact with enterprises and the experiences they have while interacting with them. The methodology details a set of stages that are divided into phases which in turn are made up of activities. It places special emphasis on the incorporation of semantics descriptions and 3D visualization in the implementation of those new services. The second contribution is a system developed for a real manufacturing scenario, using the proposed methodology, which allows to observe the possibilities that this kind of systems can offer to SMEs in two phases of the customer life cycle: Discover & Shop, and Use & Service. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",CAD; Customer life cycle; Industry 4.0; Ontology,Industry 4.0; Sales; Semantics; Service industry; Supply chains; Three dimensional computer graphics; 3D Visualization; Digital manufacturing; Manufacturing enterprise; New services; Roadmap; Small and medium manufacturing enterprise; Software services; Life cycle,Article,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85100065198

While current clinical procedures that aim to reconstruct hard and soft tissue defects resulting from periodontal disease, congenital or acquired pathology, and maxillofacial trauma often utilize mass-produced biomaterials created for a variety of surgical indications, AM represents a paradigm shift in manufacturing at the individual patient level. Computer-aided systems employ algorithms to design customized, image-based scaffolds with high external shape complexity and spatial patterning of internal architecture guided by topology optimization. 3D bioprinting and surface modification techniques further enhance scaffold functionalization and osteogenic potential through the incorporation of viable cells, bioactive molecules, biomimetic materials and vectors for transgene expression within the layered architecture.

Advances in recent years in the field of methods of tensor decompositions have significantly reduced memory for storage and reduced the computational time in solving high dimensional problems. Simulation of modern radio-frequency (RF) circuits, especially for RF integrated circuits, is one of the areas of extensive scientific research and development. The main problem of analysis methods for circuit design of RF microwave electronics is the significant computational costs associated with the high dimensions to be solved. This paper shows that the computational costs of circuit design are largely determined by the costs of solving a system of linear algebraic equations (SLAE). The number of equations (unknowns) can reach hundreds of thousands or more. Most of popular software tools for circuit simulation used both direct and iterative methods for solving the SLAE. The problems of these methods are indicated in the paper. Therefore, further development of methods for solving and reducing computational costs requires the use of new approaches, one of which is proposed in this paper and is associated with the use of tensor decompositions. The article presents the developed algorithm for converting a second-order matrix into a higher-order tensor. In the paper algorithms and software tools for tensor decompositions, as well as methods for solving SLAE in the representation of equations in tensor format are investigated. The results of numerical experiments and the results of comparison with traditional methods are presented. © 2021 IEEE.",CAD systems; linear equations; RF electronics; tensor decompositions; tensors,Biomedical engineering; Circuit simulation; Computer aided design; Computer aided software engineering; Computer software; Cost benefit analysis; Cost reduction; Integrated circuit manufacture; Linear equations; Numerical methods; Software design; Tensors; Timing circuits; Direct and iterative method; High-dimensional problems; Microwave electronics; Numerical experiments; Radio frequency circuit; RF integrated circuits; Scientific researches; System of linear algebraic equations; Iterative methods,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85113742650

It allows to evaluate the efficiency of the user circuit design implementation and select the basic chip architecture before its tape-out because of the computer-aided design (CAD) tools promptly adapting to any changes in the structure, circuitry and layout of a basic chip. The flexible and dynamic software customization to maintain the required FPGA or RSoC architecture is provided by the developed formalized description of the basic circuit, which is used in CAD and is represented in this paper.

Particularly for regenerative approaches, customized implants enable the surgeon to restore the cartilaginous framework of the ear without donor site morbidity. However, high development and production costs of commercially available implants impede clinical translation. For this reason, the usability of a low-cost 3D printer (Ultimaker 2+) as an inhouse-production tool for cheap surgical implants was investigated. The open software architecture of the 3D printer was modified in order to enable printing of biocompatible and biologically degradable polycaprolactone (PCL). Firstly, the printing accuracy and limitations of a PCL implant were compared to reference materials acrylonitrile butadiene styrene (ABS) and polylactic acid (PLA). Then the self-made PCL-scaffold was seeded with adipose-tissue derived stem cells (ASCs), and biocompatibility was compared to a commercially available PCL-scaffold using a cell viability staining (FDA/PI) and a dsDNA quantification assay (PicoGreen). Secondly, porous and solid patient-customized ear constructs were manufactured from mirrored CT-imagining data using a computer-assisted design (CAD) and computer-assisted manufacturing (CAM) approach to evaluate printing accuracy and reproducibility. The results show that printing of a porous PCL scaffolds was possible, with an accuracy equivalent to the reference materials at an edge length of 10 mm and a pore size of 0.67 mm. Cell viability, adhesion, and proliferation of the ASCs were equivalent on self-made and the commercially available PCL-scaffolds. Patient-customized ear constructs could be produced well in solid form and with limited accuracy in porous form from all three thermoplastic materials. Printing dimensions and quality of the modified low-cost 3D printer are sufficient for selected tissue engineering applications, and the manufacturing of personalized ear models for surgical simulation at manufacturing costs of EUR 0.04 per cell culture scaffold and EUR 0.90 (0.56) per solid (porous) ear construct made from PCL. Therefore, in-house production of PCL-based tissue engineering scaffolds and surgical implants should be further investigated to facilitate the use of new materials and 3D printing in daily clinical routine. © 2021 by the authors.

A little change in size or shape of IC engine assembly will cause an extensive chain reaction in calculating the associate modifications because of different interrelated plan issues. Therefore, the CAD model of the piston should be changed in order to match the modification(s) of the IC engine. The CAD modeling techniques, like parametric modeling, offer the answers for these issues. This paper presents a framework for generating the CAD model of an IC engine piston by using SolidWorks.

M3 couples the practice of Making (electronics, use of computer-controlled fabrication machines, and programming) with production engineering processes to produce highly customized, low batch-volume products, such as instructional science kits for elementary school classrooms. Of the skills students learn, Computer-Aided Design/Computer-Aided Manufacturing (CAD-CAM) is a key facet to the use of fabrication tools (e.g., 3D printers or laser cutters) in the M3 model. One problem, when taken into consideration of an M3 implementation, is to what ends should CAD-CAM skills be covered in the class. How can students be effectively taught CAD-CAM essentials for practical use in M3 while still avoiding a deep dive into the minutiae of the software/hardware considerations? This paper highlights a CAD-CAM sequence taught within an online distanced M3 powered class. We performed qualitative and quantitative analysis of student's submitted assignments and recorded interactions with online mentors, demonstrating how students develop core CAD-CAM skills and identify key challenges students face in the M3 structured class. Findings from the study illustrated how students were able to develop core competencies such as in CAD-CAM while characterizing the kinds of mistakes that students make in developing said competencies. We conclude on the illustration of a future iteration of an M3 curriculum, one where the challenges students typically face in CAD-CAM are purposefully woven into the assignments themselves, serving as a way to provoke awareness and improvement in skill development. © American Society for Engineering Education, 2021",,3D printers; Cams; Computer aided instruction; Computer aided manufacturing; Computer programming; Education computing; Engineering education; Students; Authentic learning; Elementary schools; Engineering process; Fabrication tool; High school classrooms; Instructional science; Learn+; Learning experiences; Manufacturing IS; Manufacturing skills; Computer aided design,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85124565682

Rising interest for customization of 3D printed inserts during surgeries combined with developing R&D speculations is driving the medical services. 3D printing technique is considered emerging digitized technology and it is beneficial for the future progression and development of customized dosage forms, prostheses, implantable medical devices, tissue making, disease modeling, and many more. 3D Printing technology has numerous benefits, such as minimum waste production, freedom of design, and the ability to make complex structures as well as rapid prototyping. Methods: Various 3D printing techniques are utilized (such as drop on solid deposition, selective laser sinter-ing/melting, drop on drop deposition, stereolithography, fused deposition modeling, and pressure-assisted tech-niques) for the preparation of various pharmaceuticals, such as tablets, films, oral films, mouth guards, pellets, polyprintlets, catheters, etc. Results: With the help of various 3D printing techniques, researchers minimize dose frequency and side effects of drugs with the formation of multilayer tablets or polypills and benefit the person who is suffering from various diseases at a particular time. For example, multilayer polypills containing paracetamol, caffeine, naproxen, chloramphenicol, prednisolone, and aspirin. This study, most importantly, demonstrated the possibility of 3D printing for making diverse polypills to advance patient personalization with the help of the 3D printing tech-nique. Conclusion: The authors hope this article will give a valuable boost to energize future researchers in the pharmaceutical field. Due to the novelty and particular highlights, 3D printing has the inborn ability to settle numerous formulation and medication conveyance challenges, which are often connected with poorly aqueous solu-bility. It has many unmet regulatory challenges that need to be addressed. © 2022 Bentham Science Publishers.",3D printing; 3D printing CAD software; challenges; drug delivery; pharmaceutical; polymers; regulatory issue; slicing software,"Acetaminophen; Aspirin; Caffeine; Chloramphenicol; Humans; Naproxen; Prednisolone; Printing, Three-Dimensional; Tablets; Technology, Pharmaceutical; acetylsalicylic acid; caffeine; chloramphenicol; naproxen; paracetamol; prednisolone; paracetamol; acid deposition; drug coating; drug delivery system; drug pellet; human; pharmaceutical care; Review; solid state; stereolithography; three dimensional printing; waste management; pharmaceutics; tablet manufacture; three dimensional printing",Review,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85138598534

Innovative clinical and technological advances are driving forces. They allow (i) the creation of new and more efficient workflows, (ii) an emergence of modified and easier procedures, and (iii) the use of alternative biomaterials with improved properties. The results are a better fit and retention of the digital complete dentures, as well as a generally high satisfaction of patient and clinician, while reducing the number of appointments and the technical input. The purpose of this narrative review is to present the historical, clinical, and technological developments in the field of digital removable complete dentures and to evaluate the future potential of this technology. Recent Findings: The fabrication of a digital complete denture either by milling separately the base and the denture teeth set-up or by milling a monolithic denture is well investigated. Concurrently the trend for fabricating complete denture bases by using the 3D print technology is growing. There is plenty of research showing that milling dentures from standardized pre-polymerized polymethyl methacrylate pucks guarantee the fabrication of homogenous objects with excellent biomaterial properties. The results indicate a better base adaptation, a higher flexural strength, an improved resistance to denture staining, and no polymerization distortion while milling. Furthermore, a sophisticated milling strategy allows to obtain a detailed and accurate intaglio and cameo surface, which is even exceeded when 3D printing. The clinical and technological freedom, to either combine selectively analog and digital steps or to take a totally digital workflow ending with milling or 3D printing, opens countless opportunities in the field of removable complete dentures. Whatever steps are taken, whatever sophisticated technology is chosen, still only the professional and individual know-how of the dentist in combination with the manual skills and the experience of the dental technologist—including especially the finish of the final product—will lead to a superior teamwork result. Limitations inherent to the milling process are the waste of raw material, the wear of milling tools, and the challenge to access undercut areas; the reasons are the milling bur size, the number of milling axes, and the limited movements of the machining axes. The advantages of additive manufacturing lay in a high resolution of complex geometries and a reduced waste of the biomaterial. As a limitation, the accuracy of the object, i.e. deformation, may be affected by several fabrication parameters, such as the polymerization light intensity, the build direction and angle, the layer thickness and numbers, the amount of supporting structures, and the post-processing procedures. However, with improved materials and techniques, printing may also become a primary method for fabricating digital complete dentures. Summary: The available clinical and technical information and multiple research demonstrate that the integration of digital steps into the workflow for fabricating removable complete dentures opens countless options, leading to the achievement of an esthetically, functionally, biologically, and technically high-quality end product. However, a longer learning curve must be considered. To simplify the fabrication methods of complete dentures in specific clinical situations, with the aim to increase efficiency and to save resources, is indicated. However, the use of conventional step-by-step approaches may still be valid for complex clinical situations. It is foreseeable that for treating edentulous patients, the evolution of new biomaterials, the introduction of sophisticated digital methods, and the development of improved software will follow attractive workflows with more standardized, easier, achievable, and predictable results. It challenges the clinician to have a more direct impact on denture construction and to provide the patient with the opportunity to participate in the esthetic designing. A generally higher efficiency and satisfaction for all partners involved in the fabrication process of removable complete dentures—patient, dental technologist, and dentist/prosthodontist—is the result. For a dental technologist, it is a great challenge to set up esthetic and functional denture teeth in an edentulous 3D space defined by the maxilla, the mandible, and the oral soft tissues. It is a question of time and partly already existing that machine learning—a branch of artificial intelligence—has the capacity to recognize specific intramaxillary and intermaxillary situations and to deliver an acceptable functional and esthetic denture teeth set-up, at least as a working base. Furthermore, with the introduction of a face scanner, the patient becomes virtually present anytime. Transferring the virtual situation in a physical articulator makes judgments and changes possible in both worlds simultaneously. Innovations such as robot technology still are in their infancy; however, there are aspirations to automatically place denture teeth into a dental arch. There is a great responsibility for a dentist and a dental technologist for fabricating high-quality removable complete dentures. Factors, such as a meticulous diagnosis and treatment planning, a personal communication between the involved persons, and a profound knowledge of the clinical and technical possibilities, should lead to an easy, simple, cost-effective, and highly satisfying denture fabrication workflow. The digitalization in this field already has and will even more activate research and clinical opportunities in the near future. The globally existing many edentulous patients will highly appreciate the excellent results. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Additive manufacturing (3D printing, rapid prototyping); CAD-CAM (computer-aided design-computer-aided manufacturing); Conventional removable complete denture; Digital denture (computer-engineered (removable) complete denture); Subtractive manufacturing (milling)",,Review,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85117102394

Since the emergence of additive manufacturing (AM), a CAD file can also be directly uploaded to a three-dimensional (3D) printer and used for production. AM techniques allow manufacturing of complex geometric objects such as bio-inspired structures and lattice structures. These structures are shapes inspired by nature and periodical geometric shapes consisting of struts interconnecting in nodes. Both structures have unique properties such as significantly reduced weight. However, geometric modeling of such structures has significant challenges due to the inability of current techniques to handle their geometric complexity. This calls for a novel modeling method that would allow engineers to design complex geometric objects. This survey paper reviews geometric modeling methods of complex structures to support bio-inspired design created for AM which includes discussing reasoning behind bio-inspired design, limitations of current modeling approaches applied to bio-inspired structures, challenges encountered with geometric modeling, and opportunities that these challenges reveal. Based on the review, a need for a novel geometric modeling method for bio-inspired geometries produced by AM is identified. A framework for such a bio-inspired geometric modeling method is proposed as a part of this work.

Skills assessment has several assessments that is performance assessment, portfolio assessment, product assessment and project assessment. Project assessment is comprehensive because it can assess from all aspects of the assessment. The fact is found in the school that teachers have not used technology in assessing the learning process. So that it takes a long time to assess and assign project assignments that are not yet optimal. One effort that can be done is to create a software of project skills assessment that contains project assessments to assist teachers in the learning assessment process on basic skills competencies that include project assignments given to students. The purpose of this study was to produce a valid software of project skills assessment on the kinetic theory of gases and thermodynamics. This type of research was R&D (Research and Development).

However, this separation of concerns can lead to long debugging and integration phases. This is because assumptions made about the implementation platform during the design phase - e.g., related to timing - might not hold in practice, thereby leading to unacceptable control performance. In order to address this, several control/architecture co-design techniques have been proposed in the literature. However, their adoption in practice has been hampered by the lack of design flows using commercial tools. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first article that implements such a co-design method using commercially available design tools in an automotive setting, with the aim of minimally disrupting existing design flows practiced in the industry. The goal of such co-design is to jointly determine controller and platform parameters in order to avoid any design-implementation gap, thereby minimizing implementation time testing and debugging. Our setting involves distributed implementations of control algorithms on automotive electronic control units (ECUs) communicating via a FlexRay bus. The co-design and the associated toolchain Co-Flex jointly determines controller and FlexRay parameters (that impact signal delays) in order to optimize specified design metrics. Co-Flex seamlessly integrates the modeling and analysis of control systems in MATLAB/Simulink with platform modeling and configuration in SIMTOOLS/SIMTARGET that is used for configuring FlexRay bus parameters. It automates the generation of multiple Pareto-optimal design options with respect to the quality of control and the resource usage, that an engineer can choose from. In this article, we outline a step-by-step software development process based on Co-Flex tools for distributed control applications.

Compared to many mechanistic computational design approaches, modeling and simulating humans, due to their inherent complexities of physiological and cognitive attributes, provides one of the most challenging undertakings. With the rapidly expanding use of computer, sensor, and visualization technologies, digital human modeling (DHM) emerged as a computerized design support methodology that enables modeling and simulation of humans within a computer-aided design (CAD) or virtual environment (VE). Implementing DHM with physical or digital mockups brings the advantages of running various “what-if” design scenarios early in design; thus, enhancing concept generation efforts by filtering out infeasible ideas and exploring better design alternatives. A modern product development process with DHM can also help to reduce the overall cost and time required in the long run. Although several DHM software packages are available and many companies have been designing with DHM, the domain has not reached maturity in resolving theoretical research questions and fostering simulation-based ergonomics practice. Besides, the growing body of literature, software platforms, and technology integration makes it challenging for newcomers and specialists from disciplines other than human factors engineering (HFE) to recognize the power of DHM tools. This paper aims to provide a comprehensive review of the DHM domain and summarize the evolution, current status, and future trends of the DHM design support tools. We hope this review will provide a guideline for designers and serve as a roadmap for current and future researchers interested in DHM-related research to find out new venues and opportunities for further international collaborations. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,Computer aided design; Computer software; Ergonomics; Product design; Virtual reality; Computational design; Computational modeling and simulation; Design approaches; Design-process; Digital human models; Future methods; Inherent complexity; Mechanistics; Modeling and simulating; Modeling and simulation tools; Product development,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85118132733

We show that the underlying hierarchical structure of a project (and its schedule), as well as that of a program, is essentially the same. We argue that this methodology, as a design tool, will allow the project designer, as well as the programmer, to think in a more holistic way, leading to the design of a time-efficient program, or project schedule.

DfMA principles are currently applied downstream of the 3D modelling, by following the well-known rules available from the literature and company’s know-how. The paper provides a method to acquire, elaborate and represent DfMA rules sets to aid designers and engineers in developing mechanical products. This research work wants to define a general method able to couple DfMA design guidelines (knowledge-based design) with geometrical product features available by the investigation of the 3D model. The analysis of the 3D CAD model allows to anticipate manufacturing issues and to control manufacturing cost during product design. Moreover, a framework to embed this approach within a 3D CAD system is presented for future development in a software tool. Two case studies, a simple casing made of six parts and a centrifugal pump made of sixty-eight parts, highlight how the proposed method allows easy deployment of this approach in DfMA projects.

As geometry handling in native full Knowledge-based Engineering approaches can still be a challenging and time-consuming task, approaches for utilizing the parametric modeling capabilities of high-level CAD packages were developed. With the rise of web-based technologies, bringing these utilizing approaches to the Web, seems to be the next step in the technological development of Knowledge-based Engineering applications.

In this paper, the authors are particularly interested in advanced three-dimensional design packages such as Inventor and SolidWorks, interactive mathematical and simulation environments such as Matlab, Simulink, Simscape Multibody and Robot Operating System, and several application development languages such as C# and Python. A few of them will be used throughout the paper in a collection of examples that use the new Kassow 810 collaborative robot as a test-case demonstration. In the process, the authors expect readers to fully understand how to use all these tools to other machines and to their own designs. Design/methodology/approach: Consequently, the paper follows a step-by-step practical procedure, fully tested and explained using the already mentioned state-of-the-art collaborative robot, guiding the reader from the design, modeling, simulation and application development phases, which may be applied to other machines and robotic designs. Findings: The results clearly show that the procedure of starting from a CAD design to generate the kinematic and dynamic models of a robot manipulator create representations of the robot, generate trajectories and simulate/visualize the robot motion is feasible and accessible to a general user (using standard tools). Research limitations/implications: Although the paper uses a few particular software packages, the concepts and kept general, which means that they can be used with other equivalent tools. With that objective in mind, the paper introduces the basic robotics concepts involved, further increasing in this way its tutorial structure.

Therefore, it is possible to produce new parts, products, and assemblies based on existing physical models. In addition, the RE allows correction and improvement of models, product inspection, and the documentation of parts information. However, quick and practical methods must be established during the production chain, in which the entire technological apparatus must be used in the best possible way, with the intention of providing adequate information and material flow. The availability of reference materials is important for the exchange of information and popularization of this process, benefiting several academics, professionals, and companies, who see in the benchmark process a fundamental piece for solving problems. Therefore, in this paper, a RE based approach is proposed to aid the creation of a digital model from an already existing physical model.

The implementation of adaptable architectures is very often ad hoc, quickly gets cumbersome and expensive. Reusable solutions that support complex, runtime reasoning for robot adaptation have been seen in the adoption of ontologies. While the usage of ontologies significantly increases system reuse and maintainability, it requires additional effort from the application developers to translate requirements into formal rules that can be used by an ontological reasoner. In this paper, we present a design tool that facilitates the specification of reconfigurable robot skills. Based on the specified skills, we generate corresponding runtime models for self-adaptation that can be directly deployed to a running robot that uses a reasoning approach based on ontologies.

Usually, this leads to a complete renewal of the Computer-Aided Design (CAD) and Manufacturing sequence of such parts, which is tedious and time-consuming. This paper proposes developing an integrated smart system for automated remodeling and manufacturing of such reconfigurable standard components. It includes three main steps: automatic remodeling of CAD model, automatic feature extraction from XML, and Computer Numerical Control (CNC) part program generation with minimal human intervention. In case the user adds new features to the standard design of the component, the proposed system can extend its ability by enabling automatic recognition of general machining features using the STEP AP-203 file. The whole development process of standard products is serialized by parameters and computations to achieve an automated design procedure that is integrated into Autodesk Inventor software. It is then combined with the developed algorithm of automatic feature recognition and automated toolpath generation using Vb.net. The modular design of the system allows the reconfiguration of the individual modules to include extra capabilities without affecting the whole system.

STEP file contains 3D data in the universal data format (ISO 10303-21) structured in boundary representation (B-rep) methodology. It has the potential of exchanging data models between CAD/CAM and CNC systems for generating tool paths in G-Code (ISO 6983) format. However, the complexity of STEP models is a significant challenge for wider use. Conventionally, G-code generation currently uses CAM software as an add-on, and it entails high installation costs. Also, this software usually only embraces a particular CAD design format. The development of the integrated interface system for CNC machining provides an alternative to G-code generation by bypassing CAM software in modern manufacturing systems requiring a potential advanced computer controller in the future. This research discusses the design, implementation, development, and testing of the Integrated Interface System (IIS) using the knowledge discovery approach. This system can generate Geometric Code (G-Code) based on ISO 6983 and provide tool path generation for machining operation using STEP files as input. The system provides the function to read and extract the STEP file's relevant information that eventually writes a G-Code file format as an output file related to machining data. The Geometric Data Extraction (GDE) algorithm has been used to identified feature information, recognize various strings, and interpret them in G-code terms for CNC programming. A geometric data processing algorithm is designed and developed into a computer interface. The sample block consisting of geometric features is modelled from a 3D CAD model and saved in STEP file format. The machining process is carried out by milling the sample parts using the generated G-codes using Mach4 as a PC based CNC controller.

There are numerous advantages derived from this software in textile designing, even though it is a graphic design program. Despite the numerous design advantages, the software presents technical constraints to textile design students and beginners in its visual representation of motif and texture pattern sizes. This problem of screen resolution settings affected the actual view of motif print sizes and texture patterns when printed in hard copy in relation to the soft copy for screen development. Furthermore, it affects design details during colour separation, screen copying and developing, and printing. The study employed the practiced-led research method in its approach to explore the possibilities of finding preferential screen resolution settings suitable for textile designing in Adobe Photoshop. The study revealed adjustments or modifications of the view-preferential settings of the program to ascertain the required screen resolution settings for textile motif and texture pattern sizes. This revelation bridged the visual differences between the soft copy and hard copy sizes of motif and texture pattern during and after designing.

This paper examines the coupling of user-centered design processes with modern distributed systems. Further in this paper, we describe approaches for conceptualizing a product that solves a recognized need: to develop a data gateway to serve the data management and research needs of experimentalists of electron microscopes and similar shared scientific instruments in the context of a research service laboratory. The purpose of the data gateway is to provide secure, controlled access to data generated from a wide range of scientific instruments. From the functional perspective, we focus on the basic processing of raw data that underlies the lab's ""business""processes, the movement of data from the laboratory to central access and archival storage points, and the distribution of data to respective authorized users. Through the gateway interface, users will be able to share the instrument data with collaborators or copy it to remote storage servers. Basic pipelines for extracting additional metadata (through a pluggable parser framework) will be enabled. The core contribution described in this paper, building on the aforementioned distributed data management capabilities, is the adoption of user-centered design processes for developing the scientific user interface. We describe the user-centered design methodology for exploring user needs, iteratively testing the design, learning from user experiences, and adapting what we learn to improve design and capabilities. We further conclude that user-centered design is, in turn, best enabled by an adaptable distributed systems framework. A key challenge to implementing a user-centered design is to have design tools closely linked with a software system architecture that can evolve over time while providing a highly available data gateway. A key contribution of this paper is to share the insights from crafting such an evolvable design-build-evaluate-deploy architecture and plans for iterative development and deployment. © 2021 IEEE.",Apache Airavata; Flexible Architecture; Instrument Gateways; LIMS; User Centered Design,Access control; Cluster computing; Computer architecture; Digital storage; Distributed database systems; Grid computing; Information management; Iterative methods; Legacy systems; Software design; User experience; User interfaces; Cloud-based architectures; Computing infrastructures; Distributed data managements; Iterative development; Scientific applications; Scientific instrument; User-centered design process; Wide-area distributed systems; User centered design,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85114883164

In recent years, the pathology field has evolved to a digital era where tissue samples are digitised and evaluated on screen. As a result, digital pathology opened up many research opportunities, allowing the development of more advanced image processing techniques, as well as artificial intelligence (AI) methodologies. Nevertheless, despite colorectal cancer (CRC) being the second deadliest cancer type worldwide, with increasing incidence rates, the application of AI for CRC diagnosis, particularly on whole-slide images (WSI), is still a young field. In this review, we analyse some relevant works published on this particular task and highlight the limitations that hinder the application of these works in clinical practice. We also empirically investigate the feasibility of using weakly annotated datasets to support the development of computer-aided diagnosis systems for CRC from WSI. Our study underscores the need for large datasets in this field and the use of an appropriate learning methodology to gain the most benefit from partially annotated datasets.

This system is intended for Industry 4.0, i.e. smart industrial production, that connects (integrates) cyber-physical systems with modern information and communication technologies. In Industry 4.0, machine vision systems and knowledge-based perceptions involving artificial intelligence are of great importance. The new principle of visual perception, described in this paper, will be used by the robot controller for faster and more accurate planning of the movement and manipulative actions of the robot in unstructured conditions, less tidy workspace and normal ambient lighting. The visual perception system uses the methods of classical 3D machine vision, a structured database containing CAD models of objects, technical drawings and photographs of bodies made from different angles of observation. The database also stores useful information on the technological stages of the implementation of operations on read objects using a syntax that is understandable to a robotic controller. The controller uses recorded images of objects and/or video streams from the scene or from the task workspace. In doing so, the robot uses artificial intelligence algorithms to reconstruct the scene from an incomplete set of object geometry data and determine unknown objects and their positions, and then create a strategy for capturing and manipulating bodies in accordance with the requirements of the technological process. The experimental system of a bi-manual collaborative robot, for the verification of the concept of knowledge-supported visual perception, is in the phase of physical integration of the system, so simulation results will be demonstrated here. For this purpose, the Robotic Vision Toolbox for the Mathworks’ Matlab/Simulink was used, which is connected to one Microsoft RealSense RGB-D camera as a video sensor via the appropriate software interface. The results of the experimental verification are presented in the corresponding figures in the paper with expert comments attached.

To expand the capabilities of the virtual engineering of tribological components such as bearings or brakes, the hereby presented approach allows for the depiction of real rough surfaces in finite element simulations. Rough surfaces are scanned by a white-light interferometer (WLI) and further processed by removing the outliers and replacing non-measured samples. Next, a spline generation creates a solid body, which is imported to CAD software and afterwards meshed with triangle and quadrilateral elements in different sizes. The results comprise the evaluation of six differently manufactured (turned, coated, and pressed) real surfaces. The surfaces are compared by the deviations of the roughness values after measuring with the WLI and after meshing them. Furthermore, the elements’ aspect ratios and skewness describe the mesh quality. The results show that the transfer is dependent upon deep cliffs and large Sz values in comparison to the lateral expansion. © 2021 by the authors.

While the earliest construction methodologies, such as simple Holliday junctions or tiles, could reasonably be designed on pen and paper in a short amount of time, the advent of complex techniques, such as DNA origami or DNA bricks, require software to reduce the time required and propensity for human error within the design process. Where available, readily accessible design software catalyzes our ability to bring techniques to researchers in diverse fields and it has helped to speed the penetration of methods, such as DNA origami, into a wide range of applications from biomedicine to photonics. Here, we review the historical and current state of CAD software to enable a variety of methods that are fundamental to using structural DNA technology. Beginning with the first tools for predicting sequence-based secondary structure of nucleotides, we trace the development and significance of different software packages to the current state-of-the-art, with a particular focus on programs that are open source. © 2021 by the authors.

The ease of use, prototyping accuracy and low cost makes it a widely used additive manufacturing technique. FDM creates 3D structures through the layer-by-layer melt-extrusion of a plastic filament. The production of a printed structure involves the generation of a digital design of the model by 3D design software and its execution by the printer until the complete model is reproduced. This review presents the current status of FDM, how to handle and operate FDM printers, industry standards of printing, the types of filaments that can be used, the post-processing treatments, advantages, and limitations as well as an overview of the increasing application fields of FDM technology. The application areas of FDM are endless, including biomedicine, construction, automotive, aerospace, acoustics, textiles, and occupational therapy amongst others. Even during the current Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, FDM has helped to fabricate face masks, ventilators and respiratory systems, respiratory valves, and nasopharyngeal swabs for COVID-19 diagnosis. FDM 3D and 4D printing can produce polymeric and composite structures of various designs, and compositions in a range of materials according to the desired application. The review concludes by discussing the future prospects for FDM. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.",3D printing; Biomedical applications; Fused deposition modelling; Scaffolds; Tissue engineering,3D modeling; Deposition; Diagnosis; Fused Deposition Modeling; Melt spinning; Printing presses; Respiratory system; Scaffolds (biology); 3-D printing; 3D-printing; Application prospect; Biomedical applications; Current status; Deposition modeling; Fused deposition modeling; Future prospects; Printing techniques; Tissues engineerings; Medical applications,Review,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85116585682

Although these applications have reached a good level of maturity, their use in the artistic field is still not so widespread, due to an initial barrier probably caused by a lack of accessible documentation and best practices. This article aims to analyse and experiment a variety of open source Computer Aided Design (CAD) applications with the goal of further spread the use of open source CAD software among media artists, designers,and researchers in the field of STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, Mathematics) applications[17].

During the Fontan procedure, a vascular graft is sutured between the inferior vena cava and pulmonary artery to divert deoxygenated blood flow to the lungs via passive flow. Customizing the graft configuration can maximize the long-term benefits. However, planning patient-specific procedures has several challenges, including the ability for physicians to customize grafts and evaluate their hemodynamic performance. Objective: The aim of this study was to develop a virtual reality (VR) Fontan graft modeling and evaluation software for physicians. A user study was performed to achieve 2 additional goals: (1) to evaluate the software when used by medical doctors and engineers, and (2) to explore the impact of viewing hemodynamic simulation results in numerical and graphical formats. Methods: A total of 5 medical professionals including 4 physicians (1 fourth-year resident, 1 third-year cardiac fellow, 1 pediatric intensivist, and 1 pediatric cardiac surgeon) and 1 biomedical engineer voluntarily participated in the study. The study was pre-scripted to minimize the variability of the interactions between the experimenter and the participants. All participants were trained to use the VR gear and our software, CorFix. Each participant designed 1 bifurcated and 1 tube-shaped Fontan graft for a single patient. A hemodynamic performance evaluation was then completed, allowing the participants to further modify their tube-shaped design. The design time and hemodynamic performance for each graft design were recorded. At the end of the study, all participants were provided surveys to evaluate the usability and learnability of the software and rate the intensity of VR sickness. Results: The average times for creating 1 bifurcated and 1 tube-shaped graft after a single 10-minute training session were 13.40 and 5.49 minutes, respectively, with 3 out 5 bifurcated and 1 out of 5 tube-shaped graft designs being in the benchmark range of hepatic flow distribution. Reviewing hemodynamic performance results and modifying the tube-shaped design took an average time of 2.92 minutes. Participants who modified their tube-shaped graft designs were able to improve the nonphysiologic wall shear stress (WSS) percentage by 7.02%. All tube-shaped graft designs improved the WSS percentage compared to the native surgical case of the patient. None of the designs met the benchmark indexed power loss. Conclusions: VR graft design software can quickly be taught to physicians with no engineering background or VR experience. Improving the CorFix system could improve performance of the users in customizing and optimizing grafts for patients. With graphical visualization, physicians were able to improve WSS percentage of a tube-shaped graft, lowering the chance of thrombosis. Bifurcated graft designs showed potential strength in better flow split to the lungs, reducing the risk for pulmonary arteriovenous malformations. ©Byeol Kim, Phong Nguyen, Yue-Hin Loke, Vincent Cleveland, Xiaolong Liu, Paige Mass, Narutoshi Hibino, Laura Olivieri, Axel Krieger.",congenital heart disease; heart; surgery; surgical planning; usability study; virtual reality,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85133154425

The focus of the project HOLISHIP and its bottom-up integration platform(s) was the design of maritime assets at the early design phases in heterogeneous environments. As it is often the situation, tools and systems come from different developers, companies and research institutes. So far they have been mostly used as stand-alone applications with the design team being responsible for proper tool execution, data exchange and management. Within HOLISHIP the tools and systems were coupled to CAESES®, i.e., a cross-platform Process Integration and Design Optimization (PIDO) environment that also provides comprehensive Computer Aided Design (CAD) functionality for the parametric modelling of shapes. Any tool or system that can be run in batch-mode can be coupled to CAESES and can be set up in order to exchange data with other tools, supporting the assembly of sophisticated synthesis models.

The technology transfer has taken place into engineering design practice for two decades now through the introduction of design guidelines. However, the lack of design software in the market as well as the limited academic education of present engineers has been an obstacle against the wide spread of this technology as a preferred alternative for repair and strengthening. Recently, a US-based group has responded to this need by developing professional interactive software to analyze and design structural elements strengthened with FRP. One of the very first products that came out of this effort was the development of a detailed analysis and design tool on strengthening of RC beams. This software complies with the provisions of ACI 440.2R-17 and is available interchangeably in SI and US customary unit systems. It is capable of analyzing rectangular, T and inverted L sections strengthened with externally bonded FRP or NSM bars. It allows for one compression layer and three tension layers of steel and provides strength and serviceability calculations. It has a graphics tool for to-scale drawing of sections, and it offers a detailed professional design report. The premium version is equipped with a graphics based optimized design feature that eliminates the need to perform design iterations. Its user-friendly interface is an asset to any design office. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Design tools; Flexural strengthening; FRP sheets; NSM bars; RC beams,Concrete beams and girders; Engineering education; Product design; Reinforced concrete; Software design; Strengthening (metal); Design softwares; Design tool; Externally bonded; Flexural strengthening; FRP sheet; Near surface mounted; Near surface mounted bar; Optimized designs; R.C beams; RC beams; Technology transfer,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85121920712

Numerous papers have been published, approaches have been formally built and methodologies have been developed. Despite these achievements, attempts at a wider and more effective application of KBE in industry still encounter various difficulties, both in the process of creating KBE applications and in conducting their further development. The reasons for this state of affairs are both the rapidly evolving IT reality of modern industry and the need for KBE methods, tools and solutions to keep up with it. Nowadays, many directions in KBE development and improvement as well as their industrial implementation are possible. The authors have examined a number of them, analysed and evaluated the obtained results, and proposed sets of guidelines that can both improve the quality of applied KBE solutions and make their development processes more efficient. The study includes references to various information streams present in industry, various structures of this information, and their impact on the developed solutions. The influence of external conditions was also taken into account. The work also presents real, industrial examples of generating, developing and applying UML templates in knowledge modelling for the needs of KBE applications. The applied templates are the result of a synthetic reflection based on standard programming constructions used by teams of programmers in specific industrial conditions.

Many researchers have worked for the improvement of conventional solar still to enhance productivity. Costly and time-consuming processes of operation in solar stills encourage many scholars to analyze mathematical simulation. This paper presents comprehensive reviews of the application of different design software to solar still systems. Design software is essential for developing and analyzing the mathematical models and predicting the most suitable performance parameters for the enhanced production rate of distilled water for still systems. Numerical modeling of solar still systems is necessary to analyze and investigate air movement, temperature variation for knowing water temperature, and air temperature through software like CFD, MATLAB, FORTRAN, TRYNSYS AutoCAD. The simulation technique's application using CFD is made with TRNSYS, FLUENT, ANSYS, FORTRAN and MATLAB which are useful tools to develop such mathematical models for the prediction of flow parameters. Engineering Equation Solver (EES) package and COMSOL Multiphysics solve the differential energy balance equation. All newly developed software employed for the utility of still solar systems is discussed.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate usability of three established virtual surgical planning software applications by comparing feasibility, time consumption, and costs in a standardized workflow for a modified intraoral quadrangular Le Fort II osteotomy (IQLFIIO). Results: A cross-sectional study was performed based on retrospective and re-planned data of patients with midfacial deficiency treated by modified IQLFIIO, using three software applications: IPS Case Designer ®, Dolphin Imaging ®, and ProPlan CMF ®. Feasibility: All evaluated steps of the VSP procedure could be successfully performed in all three evaluated applications. In all software packages, it was possible to design the surgical splints with CAD/CAM technology. Working time: The mean value of time needed was IPS Case Designer ®, 36.5 min; Dolphin Imaging ®, 33.6 min; ProPlan CMF ®, 45.5 min. We found statistical significant difference between ProPlan CMF ® and Dolphin Imaging ® (p value, 0.02). Costs: Asset costs for acquiring the software, license fee, license possibilities, paying for support services, and service contracts were evaluated and are found in similar ranges. Conclusion: All three tested software applications are usable for virtual planning of an IQLFIIO and splint production by CAD/CAM technology. Successful movement of bone segments and overlaying soft tissues proved feasibility. Time consumption and costs were found in similar ranges. © 2021, The Author(s).",CAD/CAM technology; Intraoral quadrangular Le Fort II osteotomy; Orthognathic surgery; Time and cost in corrective maxillofacial surgery; Virtual surgical planning,algorithm; Article; comparative study; computer assisted tomography; cone beam computed tomography; cost benefit analysis; cross-sectional study; face disorder; feasibility study; follow up; human; malocclusion; maxillofacial surgery; osteotomy; retrospective study; scoring system; working time,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85114683768

The weight of a wiring cable is increasing year by year because of the recent development on high-voltage wiring systems, hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) and electric vehicles (EVs). Clip failure, loosening clip and terminal breakage under engine roll condition is a common issue in powertrain electric cable (or body harness routing) development cycle in automotive industry. Usage of more number of clips in cable routing results in the powertrain design being more complex and it increases manufacturing cost. The standard procedure practiced to develop any dynamic envelope is by using CAD software tools and performing rigid body movements with the help of the motion file. However, the limitation of this procedure is that it could not be applied to cables, hoses or any component that experiences partial movement (i.e. components connected between body/frame and engine/other moving components). This limitation of the existing method makes it unusable for the wiring harness and cables routing study. To overcome the existing limitation, a new method was developed with the help of CAE software employing finite element methods where any study of deformable bodies could be performed. Finite element analysis enables upfront design improvement to decide number of clips required for cable routing and optimum distance between clips required. The root cause for Cable terminal failure and solution for improving design addressed in the design development cycle. Modeling of individual strands and the importance of strands modeling for FE simulation is another challenging topic that is discussed in this paper. It should be also used as an opportunity to optimize the design from cost, serviceability and assembly point of view. Input load value for this study is calculated from drive unit power train movement in different scenarios. There are 24-engine movement scenarios that are identified as the worst case for load calculation. The objective of this paper is to present the virtual validation process for powertrain mounted electric cable, which encountered a structural problem in physical validation under Engine roll conditions.

In this new design approach, the user defines every segment of the print-path along with all printing parameters, which may be related to geometric and non-geometric factors, at all points along the print-path. Machine control code (GCode) is directly generated by the software, without the need for any programming skills and without using computer-aided design (CAD), STL-files or slicing software. Excel is used as the front end for the software, which is written in Visual Basic. Case studies are used to demonstrate the broad range of structures that can be designed using the software, including: precisely controlled specimens for printer calibration, parametric specimens for hardware characterisation utilising hundreds of unique parameter combinations, novel mathematically defined lattice structures, and previously inconceivable 3D geometries that are impossible for traditional slicing software to achieve. The FullControl design approach enables unconstrained freedom to create nonplanar 3D print-paths and break free from traditional restrictions of layerwise print-path planning. It also allows nozzle movements to be carefully designed - both during extrusion and while travelling between disconnected extrusion volumes - to overcome inherent limitations of the printing process or to improve capabilities for challenging materials. An industrial case study shows how explicit print-path design improved printer reliability, production time, and print quality for a production run of over 1000 parts. FullControl GCode Designer offers a general framework for unconstrained design and is not limited to a particular type of structure or hardware; transferability to lasers and other manufacturing processes is discussed. Parametric design files use a few bytes or kilobytes of data to describe all details that are sent to the printer, which greatly improves shareability by eliminating any risk of errors being introduced during STL file conversion or due to different users having inconsistent slicer settings. Adjustable parameters allow GCode for revised designs to be produced instantly, instead of the laborious traditional routine using multiple software packages and file conversions. The FullControl design concept offers new opportunities for creative and high-precision use of additive manufacturing systems. It facilitates design for additive manufacturing (DfAM) at the smallest possible scale based on the fundamental nature of the process (i.e. assembly of individual extrusions).

The conceptual notions of the Learning Objective Design Deck are illustrated and important arguments for the use of a card deck in context of learning objective design workshops are presented. The methodical tool aimed at educators and instructional designers is comprised of a canvas and a card deck that can be used in both physical, in form of an actual card deck, and digital formats, e.g. on collaborative synchronous digital whiteboard solutions.

To achieve more accurate results, researchers need to use large and complex datasets. Sequence alignment is a well-known field of bioinformatics that allows the comparison of different genomic sequences. The comparative genomics field allows the comparison of different genomic sequences, leading to benefits in areas such as evolutionary biology, agriculture, and human health (e.g., mutation testing connects unknown genes to diseases). However, software engineering best practices, such as software performance engineering, are not taken into consideration in most bioinformatics tools and frameworks, which may lead to serious performance problems. Having an estimate of the software performance in the early phases of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is beneficial in making better decisions relating to the software design. Software performance engineering provides a reliable and observable method to build systems that can achieve their required performance goals. In this paper, we introduce the use of the Palladio Component Modeling (PCM) methodology to predict the performance of a sequence alignment system. Software performance engineering was not considered during the original system development. As a result of the performance analysis, an alternative design is proposed. Comparing the performance of the proposed design against the one already developed, a better response time is obtained. The response time of the usage scenario is reduced from 16 to 8.6 s. The study results show that using performance models at early stages in bioinformatics systems can help to achieve better software system performance. © 2021 by the authors.

It is an efficient alternative to traditional technologies based on using strain gauges. It has been shown that the use of traditional technologies to experimentally investigate the SSS of heat engine complex details when using the strain gauges requires a significant amount of research and time. Thus, deploying physical effects previously not used for solving similar problems is a perspective research direction that includes laser interferometry technology. The article deals with its use to experimentally investigate the SSS of complex details, such as a crankcase block of an internal combustion engine (ICE). Laser interferometry research is based on the use of holographic interferometry, speckle photography, electronic speckle pattern interferometry, and modern methods of computer simulation. The article goes on to say that to achieve the aim and solve the tasks of the research, it is necessary to iDevelop the scientific research methodology and methods of its implementation with a wide variety of computer-aided design (CAD)/computer-aided manufacturing (CAM)/computer-aided engineering (CAE) hardware and software use in all stages of the heat engine modeling, design, and production. iiDevelop suitable devices (sensors, systems of physical parameter recording and database creation systems, etc.), and as a result - develop a research hardware and software system. iiiCreate a database to verify computer models of the research objects. The article shows that the suggested methodology and tools for its implementation to analyze the SSS of heat engine complex details have high information capacity and accuracy of determining displacement/deformation. Thus, for example, the deformation field of the ICE crankcase block affected by the internal pressure was registered as small as 0.1 microns.

Efficiently coordinating computations on both the host (CPU) and devices (GPUs), along with host–device data transfers is critical to achieving real-time performance. However, such coordination is challenging for system designers given the complexity of modern image processing applications and the targeted processing platforms. In this paper, we present a novel model-based design tool that automates and optimizes these critical design decisions for real-time image processing implementation. The proposed tool consists of a compile-time static analyzer and a run-time dynamic scheduler. The tool automates the process of scheduling dataflow tasks (actors) and coordinating CPU–GPU data transfers in an integrated manner. The approach uses an unfolded dataflow graph representation of the application along with thread-pool-based executors, which are optimized for efficient operation on the targeted CPU–GPU platform. This approach automates the most complicated aspects of the design and implementation process for image processing system designers, while maximizing the utilization of computational power, reducing the memory footprint for both the CPU and GPU, and facilitating experimentation for tuning performance-oriented designs. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",,Data flow analysis; Data transfer; Graphics processing unit; Program processors; Scheduling; Software design; Systems analysis; Design and implementations; Image processing algorithm; Image processing applications; Image processing system; Performance-oriented designs; Real time performance; Real-time image processing; Software design and implementation; Image processing,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85087619805

With the emerging development of computer engineering and technology recent advances in microwave communication using microwave integrated circuits, high frequency signals can be sent and taken back even in war fields. These can be controlled by the frequency. The present paper aims at the frequency control over the loss of energy of waves passing through microstrip line transmission structure using computer aided design (CAD) technique. The advent of MICROWAVE INTEGRATED CIRCUIT (MIC) has changed the old, bulky and lossy communication systems to the small, lightweight and easily replaceable assembly by introducing planer transmission structure and their variants. The early ""cut and try""method using ruler and knife have been changed by a fast emergence computer system and CAD technique has been developed. This enables the communication of information signals less lossy. Hence the paper to be presented is frequency control over loss of energy of waves passing through microstrip line structure.

As a main difference with the rest of literature that works with quasi-developable surfaces assuming the fact that most of practical materials allow for a little bit of stretching, this paper presents how to quantify this developability in terms of a geometrical factor, the limit warp angle. The limit warp angle has been calculated numerically for steel and aluminum, applying a bending moment to plates of different geometries until a given percentage of the material's yield stress is surpassed. It has been demonstrated that developability depends on the material properties, thickness and aspect ratio of the plates that will be used to construct the real surface. The presented approach considers both physics and geometry and links them together. By considering the limit warp angle, a quasi-developable surface can be obtained without altering the directrices shape, unless the directrix curves present a very different shape between each other. This is very useful in engineering applications that produce designs based on curves and ease the use of parametric design techniques into the object definition. The constrained or parametric definition of ship hulls is beneficial during the initial phases of the ship design because it speeds up the creation process, provides more clarity about the influence of various parameters, and allows for the development of a range of concept hull surfaces.

A digital twin is an accurate digital copy of something that exists or is planned to be realized in the physical world. The digital twin is not only a virtual model of the physical system, but also a dynamic data and status information carrier obtained through a series of IoT-connected sensors that collect data from the physical world and send it to machines. The digital twin provides an overview of what is happening to the device in real time. This is very important in industry as this information is helpful to reduce maintenance issues and ensure production performance. This work focuses on the design and creation of a cybernetic physical system and its digital twin, based on CAD system modeling in conjunction with simulation and programming tools connected to real and simulated control systems. This process accelerates the development of the application implementation with the possibility to create a PLC control program and tune the system already in the design phase. Thus, the physical realization can be done in parallel with the programming and creation of the HMI interface. Modular programming will further accelerate software development [1]. The created system and its digital twin serve as a unified teaching tool without the need for real devices to be used by many students and users.

It helps in reducing design time with high level of accuracy. Generally, cost of product development and manufacturing is identified in design phase, so it is important to focus on the design phase to reduce the total cost of the product. Use of standard parts readily available in the market saves manufacturing efforts and cost associated with the same. So, it is beneficial to use such standard parts in the new design of the product. Another important point in the design phase is that any mistakes done by the designer can lead to high losses associated with design, manufacturing, and operational phases. Most of the industries rely on expert’s knowledge to avoid such losses. To avoid these losses and to make the use of standard parts, this paper proposes a knowledge-based design automation-based approach for selecting standard components in new design of the product.

Most biological designs, however, are still specified at the sequence level. Consequently, there exists a need for a tool that can be used to automatically infer component-based design representations from sequences, particularly in cases when those sequences have minimal levels of annotation. Such a tool would assist computational synthetic biologists in bridging the gap between the outputs of sequence editors and the inputs to more sophisticated design tools, and it would facilitate their development of automated workflows for design curation and quality control.

Safety assessment is based on special invariants, e.g., properties which remain unchanged when a specified transformation is applied. A classification and examples of FPGA project invariants are provided. In the paper, two types of invariants are described. The first type of invariants used for such assessment are those which are versatile since they reflect the unchanged properties of FPGA projects, hardware description languages, etc. These invariants can be replenished as experience gained in project implementation accumulates. The second type of invariants is formed based on an analysis of the specifics of a particular FPGA project and reflects the features of the tasks to be solved, the algorithms that are implemented, the hardware FPGA chips used, and the computer-aided design tools, etc. The paper contains a description of the overall conception and particular stages of FPGA projects invariant-based safety assessment. As examples for solving some tasks (using of invariants and defect injections), the paper contains several algorithms written in the VHSIC hardware description language (VHDL).

Future knowledge engineers need e.g., communicational skills in order to acquire the relevant knowledge for later implementation in design automation systems, or skills for planning, modelling, and exploring a design solution space. In a flipped classroom setup, where the responsibility for the learning process and thus several degrees of freedom regarding topics and their weighting are transferred to the students, a later summative assessment needs to fulfil two basic requirements: First to reflect the individual learning progress of a student, second to discover if the higher learning goals of the course are met. Constructive alignment is a technique to relate teaching activities, learning outcomes and assessment to each other and to the competences that a learner should acquire. The present paper reports about the assessment for a flipped classroom design automation lecture. Starting from the educational objectives and the learning activities, two different assessment mechanisms are characterized: A semester project where two or three students works as a team of knowledge engineers to create a knowledge-based engineering system, e.g., a product configurator, and an oral exam where each student has the opportunity to report about his or her individual learning process and dispute this with the teaching staff. © PDE 2021.",Constructive alignment; Flipped classroom; Knowledge-based engineering,Alignment; Application programs; Automation; Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Education computing; Engineering education; Knowledge based systems; Learning systems; Product design; Students; Automation systems; Computer-aided design software; Constructive alignments; Design automations; Design solutions; Flipped classroom; Knowledge based; Knowledge-based engineering; Planning models; Product models; Computer aided design,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85121697513

A combination of 3D CAD and 3D printing techniques facilitates highly optimized design with low unit cost and short production time. Precise control of the solution flow is critical to both minimizing the volume of solution needed and minimizing the photodamage that occurs during data acquisition. The details of an integrated four-syringe stepper-motor-driven pump and associated software are described. It is shown that combined electrochemical and flow control can allow repeated measurement of a defined volume of solution, 100 μl, of samples sensitive to photoreduction without significant change to the X-ray absorption near-edge structure and is demonstrated by measurements of copper(II) complexes. The flow in situ electrochemical cell allows the collection of high-quality X-ray spectral measurements both in the near-edge region and over an extended energy region as is needed for structural analysis from solution samples. This approach provides control over photodamage at a level at least comparable with that achieved using cryogenic techniques and at the same time eliminates problems associated with interference due to Bragg peaks.  © 2021 International Union of Crystallography.

The algorithm is designed to take the CAD 3D geometry of an IATP structure as input and automates the construction and analysis of the corresponding CAE model using a macroscopic element, which is an alternative to continuum Finite Element (FE) models. Each component of the macro model is assigned a unique tag that is linked to the relevant geometric and structural parameters. The CAE model integrity is maintained through the use of the common data model (CDM) concept and object-oriented programming. The relevant algorithms are implemented in Rhinoceros 3D using RhinoCommon, a. NET software development kit. Once the CAE macro model is generated, it is introduced to the OpenSees computational platform for structural analysis. The algorithmic framework is demonstrated using two case structures: a prefabricated timber beam with standard geometry and a free-form timber plate arch. The results are verified with measurements from physical experiments and FE models, where the time needed to convert thousands of CAD assemblies to the corresponding CAE models for response simulation is considerably reduced. © 2020 The Authors",Computer programming; Computer-aided design (CAD); Computer-aided engineering (CAE); Integral mechanical attachment technique; Macro modeling technique; Timber plates,Computer aided engineering; Computer aided software engineering; Geometry; Macros; Object oriented programming; Plates (structural components); Software design; Three dimensional computer graphics; Timber; Algorithmic framework; Common data model; Computational platforms; Digital architecture; Engineering informatics; Physical experiments; Software development kit; Structural parameter; Computer aided design,Article,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85097582108

In the current study, CoCrMo domes were photofunctionalized with UV radiation of 254 nm on their internal faces during 24 hr; they were implanted in rabbit tibia and remained for 3, 4, and 6 weeks. The potential to induce bone formation beneath the dome-shaped membranes was evaluated through morphometric, histologic, and density measurements; and the results were compared with those obtained under control untreated domes. Higher density values were observed for irradiated domes at 3 weeks, whereas higher volumes were obtained under photofunctionalized domes for longer periods (4 and 6 weeks). Histologically, woven bone was formed by endochondral ossification in all cases; differences in the architecture and size of the trabeculae and in the number of osteoblasts were noted between irradiated and non-irradiated samples. The UV radiation of 254 nm generated a larger bone volume fraction compared to that found in the absence of UVC radiation and induced an increase of density in the early stages of healing, leading to a better initial bone quality and improved osseointegration. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",bone regeneration; CoCrMo alloy; implant materials; tissue engineering; UVC photofunctionalization,"Animals; Bone Regeneration; Bone-Implant Interface; Chondrocytes; Chromium Alloys; Male; Membranes, Artificial; Osseointegration; Osteoblasts; Osteogenesis; Rabbits; Tibia; Tissue Engineering; Ultraviolet Rays; Bone; Chromium alloys; Cobalt alloys; Domes; Phosphate minerals; Ternary alloys; Tissue regeneration; Ultraviolet radiation; alloy; biomaterial; chromium; cobalt; molybdenum; chromium derivative; cobalt-chromium-molybdenum-carbon alloy; Bone formation; Bone volume fraction; Endochondral ossification; Guided bone regeneration; Implant materials; Irradiated samples; Osseointegration; UV-C radiations; animal experiment; animal tissue; Article; bone density; bone microarchitecture; bone quality; bone regeneration; bone volume fraction; computer assisted tomography; controlled study; enchondral ossification; healing; histology; histopathology; in vivo study; Leporidae; morphometry; nonhuman; osseointegration; osteoblast; photofunctionalization; surface property; tibia; tissue engineering; trabecular bone; ultraviolet C radiation; animal; artificial membrane; bone development; bone implant interface; bone regeneration; chondrocyte; drug effect; growth, development and aging; male; osseointegration; procedures; radiation response; tissue engineering; ultraviolet radiation; Metal implants",Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85096407985

A smart and user friendly energy management system can control the energy consumption. In this paper, load power and energy management system is developed and simulated using Proteus Visual Design software. The load analysis and measurement techniques are developed for single phase and three phase loads and implemented using Arduino Mega 2560 board. User friendly controls are developed using the visual design feature of the software to control the energy consumption. The load power management system is simulated by measuring the power consumed by various residential loads such as lights, fans, air-conditioners, heaters. The industrial loads are simulated by squirrel cage induction motor. The load analysis summary is displayed on the Arduino 2.8 inch TFT display shield in a table format. The simulaion model is created for future hardware implementation and is tested under various practical input conditions. The Proteus Visual Design software is chosen in this resesarch due to its advantages such as professional PCB layout package, availability of nearly 800 microcontrollers in the library package etc. The developed model successfully measured the energy consumption of several loads and assist the user in controlling the energy usage through automation control techniques. The accuracy of the results shows that the technique and the model developed in this research can be used by engineers, students and hobbyists who are working with energy monitoring systems and smart home applications directly. This is an ongoing project where in the next stage, the hardware design of the simulation model will be implemented and tested in real time application.

Currently different platforms are being utilized by researchers for designing VTOL aircraft which primarily include tilt rotors that serve for vertical take-off and landing and transition is done for translation of hovering configuration to fixed-wing configuration. This paper includes a specific study of the transition mechanism for VTOL UAVs, its transition from hover configuration to fixed-wing configuration, different phases of VTOL design, different configurations of rotors, and flight controller platform used for autopilot for long surveillance missions. This research is then followed by a specific design of tail-sitter VTOL UAVs which include the UAV design which follows an integrated analysis approach in which take-off weight is estimated followed by wing loading and thrust to weight ratio calculations. Design phase include an airfoil analysis using XFLR5 software followed by CAD modelling of UAV and its aerodynamic analysis. This research is then focused on the transition of VTOL UAV from VTOL mode into fixed-wing mode and vice versa. Different parameters involved during this phase are specified. During fabrication phase different techniques were used which include 3D printing of internal airframe of aircraft, laser-cutting of airfoil contours and hotwire cutting of Styrofoam. These techniques were applied using laser cutting and hotwire cutting machines available at the College of Aeronautical Engineering. Fabrication is followed by a series of flight tests which include ground test where aircraft endurance was calculated. Afterwards transition test from hovering mode into fixed-wing mode was carried out. The drone was able to achieve all the desired features successfully.  © 2021 IEEE.",fixed-wing; flight control; hover; transition mechanism; Unmanned Aerial Vehicle; Vertical take-off and landing,3D printers; Aircraft landing; Antennas; Automobile manufacture; Computer aided design; Fixed platforms; Fixed wings; Laser beam cutting; Laser beams; Machinery; Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV); Aerodynamic analysis; Design and Development; Experimental verification; Hostile environments; Surveillance missions; Thrust-to-weight ratio; Transition mechanism; Vertical take-off and landings; VTOL/STOL aircraft,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85104636999

The principles of its formation and use are proposed on the basis of a design database developed within the framework of a computer-aided design (CAD) system for thermal automation and measurements. Examples of design automation systems aimed at solving similar problems are given and the features of the proposed CAD system are indicated. The typical structure of the APCS and the relationship of its main components—sensors, cables, executive and switchboard devices, signal connection tables, as well as the software and hardware complex (composition and distribution of modules of communication devices with an object)—are described. A description of the project database’s structure is given, which provides comprehensive work with both project documentation and information about the main components of the APCS. The sequence in execution of design procedures and links between the design database and the CAD database during their implementation are shown. Methods for increasing the productivity of designers are considered, such as the use of standard solutions in the organization of measurements and control schemes for actuators of thermal power plants, multiple use of information with a single input, and synthesis of text and graphic design documentation based on the project database. It is proposed to use a digital twin at all stages of the object’s life cycle: during design, installation, commissioning, and operation. The effectiveness of working with information thanks to an intuitive interface for navigating through the project was demonstrated.

The CONVEX design approach breaks free from the traditional 3D printing workflow of filling a CAD-model volume with stacked extruded filaments of constant width and height. Instead, the geometry of each filament is explicitly designed over its entire length. The concept may disrupt a wide range of applications in both the short and long term. In the least ambitious short-term implementation of CONVEX, its principles can be integrated into 3D printing slicing software to allow a geometric form to be fitted by streamlined filaments, with constantly varying widths as required to match the overall geometry (referred to as “streamlined slicing”). The use of continuous streamlined filaments, as opposed to frequently changing the number of filaments, improved the quality of manufactured parts by eradicating voids and defects, which are known to cause critical stress concentrations in specimens for tensile testing. At the other end of the scale, in the most disruptive implementation of the CONVEX design approach, entire new material structures and product types will be enabled, with feature size-scales perhaps an order of magnitude lower than that permitted by present design rules. This will enable new innovative metamaterials and is particularly appropriate for high-value applications such as advanced filtering, tissue engineering, drug delivery, microfluidics or electronics, where the geometries of individual extruded filaments (or deliberate inter-filament pores) form the functional design geometry. To prove the technical feasibility of CONVEX, this study includes rigorous experimental work to characterise how instantaneous changes to MEAM process parameters (e.g. speed, acceleration, extrusion rate and retraction) enable highly controllable and dynamic variation of the width of extruded filaments (from 75 % to 250 % of nozzle diameter). The concept is proven for multiple materials, layer heights, extrusion temperatures, nozzle sizes, and for both Bowden and direct-drive printer types. The Bowden printer was found to be an order of magnitude less responsive to changes in extrusion rate than the direct-drive printer. Case studies demonstrate the CONVEX design approach, which has already enabled break-through micro-mechanical research for MEAM. Industrial implications are discussed along with the potential for translation to other manufacturing processes. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Additive manufacturing; Bowden tube; Metamaterials; Microscale design; Sub-filament design,Additives; Computer aided design; Controlled drug delivery; Design for manufacturability; Extrusion; Geometry; Nozzles; Printing presses; Product design; Tensile strength; Tensile testing; Tissue engineering; Design approaches; Dynamic variations; Extrusion temperatures; Functional design; Manufacturing process; Material structure; Multiple materials; Process parameters; 3D printers,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85092928390

This paper extends our earlier approach to in situ electroporating attached cells for their robust cryopreservation on artificial scaffolds. Using CAD modelling, a two-electrode setup has been designed and in-house constructed allowing for simultaneous electroporation in multi-well cell culture plates. Blend electrospinning process has been optimized in order to manufacture porous fibrous mats made of polycaprolactone (PCL, 100 mg/ml) and polylactide (PLA, 50 mg/ml) with an average thickness of 100 µm. Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were grown and directly electroporated in nanofibrous blend electrospun fiber mats. An electric pulse was applied in the presence of propidium iodide and CellTracker Green to determine viable permeabilized cell counts using fluorescence microscopy. Cell recovery was evaluated using metabolic MTS assay 24 h post-electroporation. Electric field intensity and distribution within a 3D reconstructed fiber mat was simulated and visualized using COMSOL software. The results demonstrate that with developed setup it is feasible to electroporate around 80% of attached cells with 80% viability after electroporation when electric field strength was ≥1.7 kV/cm. COMSOL simulations showed local increases of electric field at intersection points of numerous fibers which may in part contribute to the observed drop in cell viability post-electroporation.

Design/methodology/approach: First, the patterns are designed using the garment CAD software and stored in the DXF format. Second, the regular grid method is employed to mesh the patterns to be quadrangular, and the patterns triangular meshing can be obtained by connecting the diagonal of the quadrangular. Then a mass-spring model is established, and the forces analysis and the explicit Euler integration method are employed to accomplish the patterns simulation. The paper demonstrates the robustness of our simulation through two sets of experiments, including a lady’s dress patterns meshing experiments and the experiments of the virtual stitching of the lady’s dress. Findings: The patterns meshing algorithm can meet the requirements of the internal meshing and the boundary meshing, and it is very important to select an appropriate meshing density. The implementation of the virtual stitching of the lady’s dress proves the effectiveness and usability of the simulation methods. Research limitations/implications: The lady’s dress used in the experiments is a relatively simple fashion style, with only the front and back pattern. It is very worthy of further research on the effectiveness of the complex structure of clothing. Practical implications: The paper includes practical implications of the methods of the patterns meshing and the virtual stitching of the simple fashion styles. Originality/value: The simulation system is developed using VC++ 2015 with the help of the OpenGL functions library, which is proved as a simple, lower computation and robustness for the patterns simulation of the simple garments. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Mass-spring model; Patterns meshing; Regular grid method; Virtual simulation,Application programming interfaces (API); Clothes; Computer aided design; CAD softwares; Complex structure; Design/methodology/approach; Euler integration; Fashion styles; Mass-spring models; Meshing algorithm; Simulation systems; Virtual reality,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85085114210

This work describes a method to perfect the design of a custom elbow orthosis. A reverse engineering approach has been used to digitalize the patient’s arm and the subsequent CAD modelling of the structure of the custom elbow orthosis has been performed. In particular, two algorithms have been implemented for the creation of 3D patterns and Voronoi tessellations. Subsequently, FEM analyses have been carried out to validate the design. Finally, a prototype of the elbow orthosis with Voronoi tessellation has been realized by means of the SLS technology. The results obtained have demonstrated that the implemented algorithm solved the problems found during CAD modelling with conventional software. Furthermore, the results of FEM analyses have validated the design choices. All this allowed realizing the prototype by AM technologies without problems.

The approach allows formalizing tacit into explicit design knowledge, for aiding engineers during the development of metal casted components. It is based on three main pillars: (i) identification of geometrical features (3D CAD features) and parameters that can cause an issue during the manufacturing process, (ii) definition of a numerical threshold for feature parameters that guarantee the feasibility of the casting process, and (iii) representation of design rules within a CAD system to support product design review. The method is considered the starting point for future developing a software tool (CAD tool plug-in), here just presented. Two case studies are reported with the aim to show the advantages of the proposed method and tool in the identification of manufacturing issues early in the product development process.

Despite the emergence of knowledge management techniques (ontology, expert system, text mining, etc.), companies continue to store design rules in large and unstructured documents. To facilitate the integration of design rules and CAD software, we propose a knowledge graph that structures a large set of design rules in a computable format. The knowledge graph organises entities of design rules (nodes), relationships among design rules (edges), as well as contextual information. The categorisation of entities and relationships in four sub-contexts: semantic, social, engineering, and IT – facilitates the development of the data model, especially the definition of the “design context” concept. The knowledge graph paves the way to a context-aware cognitive design assistant. Indeed, connected to or embedded in a CAD software, a context-aware cognitive design assistant will capture the design context in near real time and run reasoning operations on the knowledge graph to extend traditional CAD capabilities, such as the recommendation of design rules, the verification of design solutions, or the automation of design routines. Our validation experiment shows that the current version of the context-aware cognitive design assistant is more efficient than the traditional document-based design. On average, participants using an unstructured design rules document have a precision of 0.36 whereas participants using our demonstrator obtain a 0.61 precision score. Finally, designers supported by the design assistant spend more time designing than searching for applicable design rules compared to the traditional design approach. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Cognitive assistant; Context-awareness; Design rule; Knowledge graph; Knowledge management,Expert systems; Graph structures; Knowledge management; Knowledge representation; Semantics; Text mining; Verification; Complex engineered systems; Contextual information; Design approaches; Design solutions; Document-based; Knowledge graphs; Management techniques; Unstructured documents; Computer aided design,Article,Final,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85098695374

The advantages of AM include the design and printing of diverse parts and materials such as metals, polymers, ceramics, and bioinks, which in turn can be used for the medical and biomedical applications. Traditional manufacturing techniques, such as machining, casting, and molding, have limitations due to complex part generation and high production time; however, AM can build 3D objects directly from a computer-aided design (CAD) model. This CAD model can be designed through design software or extracted directly through reverse engineering processes. 3D printing is a powerful tool to mimic complex human or animal anatomies, building implants, tissue generation, implant-tissue interfaces, dentistry, and so forth. AM technology is rapidly evolving with the advancement in materials, tooling, resolution, computational speed, high accuracy of complex parts, and faster production.

BIM is a collaboratively generated and maintained data-rich information source, especially when it comes to the energy-calculation process and beyond.

The widespread adoption of photovoltaic rooftop systems has shown that solar homes can be a effective solution to that energy demand; nowadays, the idea that BIM is not just software has been decided upon. In this paper, a new approach was used to calculate energy consumption using a BIM template designed for this purpose. The greatest value derived from BIM was in the template designed to neutralize energy consumption by calculating the number of photovoltaic panels needed to achieve a net-zero-energy house. The BIM prototype developed is considered a useful tool, intended to be used by everyday, non-specialist users to aid and disseminate energy knowledge in order to achieve a zero-energy home, as well as to be used as a decision-support tool, incorporating energy simulation into the early design process of zero-energy buildings in architectural practice. Finally, the tool was tested on a group of users in order to fine-tune and develop the design parameters of the template. © 2021",Building information modelling; Decision-support tools; Green BIM; Net-zero-energy houses; Sustainable design,Architectural design; Computer aided design; Decision support systems; Energy utilization; Photovoltaic cells; Decision support tools; Design parameters; Effective solution; Energy calculation; Information sources; Photovoltaic panels; Zero energy homes; Zero energy house; architectural design; energy planning; energy use; participatory approach; photovoltaic system; residential energy; software; solar power; Zero energy buildings,Article,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85100262239

Mockup Development in software engineering leads to the creation of a prototype that is close to being the real implementation and is used for getting feedback on the final implementation. In spite of neuromarketing giving effective marketing results, enterprises restrict the usage of such research in their marketing activities, thus resulting in the under usage of this technique. Mockup creation is a time-consuming process, being complicated for consumers to understand design concepts within a few seconds, thus becoming difficult to design a perfect consumer-preferred website. This paper proposes an idea that helps in designing mockups with the help of neuroscience and leads to a reduction in time consumed by giving the accurate design to build a website. This novel idea focuses upon using neuroscience which gives the exact consumer reaction for mockups that are used as design tools virtually everywhere a new product is designed.

The design of walking mechanism is based on the symmetrical foot-point path to get the required stability for walking on an even terrain and simplify its motion control. A systematic methodology is used for the concept generation of walking mechanisms to achieve these objectives. A brief study of a wide range of walking mechanisms developed in the past is used to develop Computer-aided Design (CAD) model of a single Degree of freedom (DOF) planar walking mechanism. An analytical method for dimensional synthesis based on path generation is used to get dimensions of linkages. Additionally, geometric constraints of motion are used to anticipate free variables to solve for unknown terms in the equation. However, the inclusion of the control system required for simulation in the CAD software is not feasible. Construction stages are shown to aid the development of the simulation model. This is accomplished by interfacing Solidworks and MATLAB/Simulink environments. This paper, in short, is an effort to develop simulation-based methods for optimizing planar mechanisms. © 2021, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",Computer-aided design; Dimensional synthesis; Geometric constraint programming; MATLAB analysis; Path generation; Simulink model,,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85088558346

We are motivated by the trend of modern CAD software towards cloud platforms and expanded collaborative features. Cloud-CAD platforms enable collaboration by increasing access, and reducing conflicts and barriers to file-sharing. In order to generate insight to support CAD collaboration, we analyze the real-world data from an industry partner's product development project, consisting of eight professional designers working on a cloud-CAD platform. This data corresponds to more than 1,420,000 actions over a span of eight months. Via hierarchical clustering, we group 79 unique CAD activities into 14 categories of CAD action groups, such as Part Studio, Assembly, Comment, View/Scan and Export. Next, we identify the degree to which each of the eight designers performs activity in these CAD action groups. We demonstrate the usefulness of this framework by highlighting insights revealed by the CAD action group mapping, confirmed via discussion with the industry partner. This CAD-type behaviour framework provides a tool for assessment and reflection on the types of behavioural tendencies present or missing on a team of designers.

The authors examined the content of parametric modeling methods in three-dimensional space. We have demonstrated the mechanism of practical application by a person of the parameters of the designed object in software. We have analyzed the combination of irrational and rational thinking in the methodology of architectural and computer design. The article discusses the future development of architecture and design in the future based on parametric architecture. The possibilities of the emergence of the latest styles and trends of parametrism are determined. Artificial intelligence and modern computer technology introduce a number of fundamentally new methods of parametric and compositional design. The synthesis of natural morphogenesis and new parametric modeling takes place at the intersection of interdisciplinarity. The mathematical algorithms of parametrism are wrapped in an aesthetic shell, an ideological essence that is dictated by human thought. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Architectural design methods; Artificial intelligence; Computer modeling; Parametric architecture; Three-dimensional environmental space,,Book chapter,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85102283357

The choices and decisions made during the product design phase have a major influence and impact on the circularity performance of products. While numerous indicators and tools have been recently developed to assess, manage, and accelerate the transition to a more circular economy, their application and usability during the early design phases of products are often overlooked. Based on a screening of several tens of circular economy indicators, the present research work identified twelve product-centric circularity indicators, each of them coming with a computational tool, to be deployed during the design process in order to improve the circularity potential of products. To help designers and engineers selecting the appropriate solution, these circularity indicators and tools are positioned on a generic five-step design process, namely: requirements definition, conceptual design, detailed design, designs comparison, product monitoring and communication. Concrete examples are given on how these indicators and their assessment framework can support the design of more circular products. Current shortcomings of available approaches are finally highlighted and discussed (such as the lack of c-indicators for the detailed design phase or linkage with computer-aided design software) for an augmented integration of such promising circularity indicators and their associated tools within the design and development process of products.

Modern protein engineering relies on the ability to rapidly generate and screen diverse libraries of mutant proteins. However, design of mutant libraries is typically hampered by scale and complexity, necessitating development of advanced automation and optimization tools that can improve efficiency and accuracy. At present, automated library design tools are functionally limited or not freely available. To address these issues, we developed Mutation Maker, an open source mutagenic oligo design software for large-scale protein engineering experiments. Mutation Maker is not only specifically tailored to multisite random and directed mutagenesis protocols, but also pioneers bespoke mutagenic oligo design for de novo gene synthesis workflows. Enabled by a novel bundle of orchestrated heuristics, optimization, constraint-satisfaction and backtracking algorithms, Mutation Maker offers a versatile toolbox for gene diversification design at industrial scale. Supported by in silico simulations and compelling experimental validation data, Mutation Maker oligos produce diverse gene libraries at high success rates irrespective of genes or vectors used. Finally, Mutation Maker was created as an extensible platform on the notion that directed evolution techniques will continue to evolve and revolutionize current and future-oriented applications.  © ",directed evolution; gene synthesis; multi site-directed mutagenesis; PCR-based accurate synthesis; protein design; protein engineering; site-scanning saturation mutagenesis; synthetic biology,"Algorithms; Codon; Computer Simulation; Directed Molecular Evolution; Escherichia coli; Gene Library; Mutagenesis; Mutagenesis, Site-Directed; Mutant Proteins; Mutation; Oligonucleotides; Proteins; Software; mutant protein; oligonucleotide; protein; algorithm; article; computer simulation; controlled study; gene library; gene synthesis; heuristics; polymerase chain reaction; protein engineering; satisfaction; saturation mutagenesis; site directed mutagenesis; software; synthetic biology; workflow; algorithm; codon; directed molecular evolution; Escherichia coli; genetics; mutagenesis; mutation; procedures; site directed mutagenesis; software",Article,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85099966895

The growing tendency towards using fractional-order proportional-integral-derivative (FOPID) control has been fueled mainly by the fact that these controllers have additional 'tuning knobs' that allow coherent adjustment of the dynamics of control systems. For instance, in certain cases, the capacity for additional frequency response shaping gives rise to the generation of control laws that lead to superior performance of control loops. These fractional-order control laws may allow fulfilling intricate control performance requirements that are otherwise not in the span of conventional integer-order control systems. However, there are underpinning points that are rarely addressed in the literature: (1) What are the particular advantages (in concrete figures) of FOPID controllers versus conventional, integer-order (IO) PID controllers in light of the complexities arising in the implementation of the former? (2) For real-time implementation of FOPID controllers, approximations are used that are indeed equivalent to high-order linear controllers. What, then, is the benefit of using FOPID controllers? Finally, (3) What advantages are to be had from having a near-ideal fractional-order behavior in control practice? In the present paper, we attempt to address these issues by reviewing a large portion of relevant publications in the fast-growing FO control literature, outline the milestones and drawbacks, and present future perspectives for industrialization of fractional-order control. Furthermore, we comment on FOPID controller tuning methods from the perspective of seeking globally optimal tuning parameter sets and how this approach can benefit designers of industrial FOPID control. We also review some CACSD (computer-aided control system design) software toolboxes used for the design and implementation of FOPID controllers. Finally, we draw conclusions and formulate suggestions for future research. © 2013 IEEE.",Fractional calculus; fractional control implementation; fractional-order PID control; frequency-domain analysis; industrial applications; optimal tuning,Computer control systems; Control theory; Frequency response; Linear control systems; Proportional control systems; Real time control; Three term control systems; Two term control systems; Computer aided control system design; Control performance; Design and implementations; Fractional order control; Future perspectives; Linear controllers; Proportional integral derivatives; Real-time implementations; Controllers,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85100508854

Moreover, the hardware design itself is currently impossible to imagine without the widespread use of CAD systems at various levels, including end-to-end.

The generalized model of RTU synthesis is proposed, which is an ordered sequence of necessary actions of the designer, allowing, depending on the specific design task, to achieve the goal.

Operating this infrastructure is a costly and complex endeavor, and efficiency is paramount. In fact, for over 15 years, a dedicated engineering team has tuned almost every aspect of this infrastructure, achieving state-of-the-art efficiency (>60% average CPU utilization across all clusters). Despite rich telemetry and strong expertise, faced with evolving hardware/software/workloads this manual tuning approach had reached its limit - -we had plateaued. In this paper, we present KEA, a multi-year effort to automate our tuning processes to be fully data/model-driven. KEA leverages a mix of domain knowledge and principled data science to capture the essence of our cluster dynamic behavior in a set of machine learning (ML) models based on collected system data. These models power automated optimization procedures for parameter tuning, and inform our leadership in critical decisions around engineering and capacity management (such as hardware and data center design, software investments, etc.). We combine ""observational'' tuning (i.e., using models to predict system behavior without direct experimentation) with judicious use of ""flighting'' (i.e., conservative testing in production). This allows us to support a broad range of applications that we discuss in this paper. KEA continuously tunes our cluster configurations and is on track to save Microsoft tens of millions of dollars per year.

Due to the increased complexity of mechanisms, a more effective proceeding is required. Since the appearance of increasingly powerful computers, the number of software tools for mechanism design had likewise increased. This huge number of software solutions can be divided into two categories—geometric software products and dedicated mechanism design software. Since most of these software solutions have disadvantages concerning the function range or usability, a new software product is under development by the Institute of Mechanism Theory, Machine Dynamics and Robotics (IGMR) of RWTH Aachen University. The consideration of new software engineering methods and software design processes allow a continuous implementation of functionalities that are not yet state of the art. One of these functionalities is the combination of analytical and numerical approaches within the kinematical analysis of planar mechanisms.

Here, the product complexity causes a wide spread of highly specialized domains, with data and expertise being distributed among different institutions and companies. Providing easy and secure access to shared and individual resources during product development is a significant challenge. Additionally, the necessity of exchanging design documents and specifications as well as data in different formats contributes to development costs and time. Digital platforms can provide a solution for these issues by allowing different institutions and experts to securely and remotely share their tools and knowledge and by providing a common data base during development. The Institute of Structures and Design of the German Aerospace Center (DLR) is currently developing the Digital Concurrent Engineering Platform (DCEP) in the context of the project IRAS (Integrated Digital Research Platform for Affordable Satellites) to enable cooperative and distributed development of satellites. The DCEP provides a web-based software platform for model-based systems engineering in the form of a parametrical representation of the design tree. Concepts and technologies to allow faithful collaboration between potentially competing companies are developed and adopted. This includes indirect access to connected software tools and databases as well as secure traceability of authorship for design decisions. The current focus of the DCEP platform are the early design phases, with support for automated design tools and algorithms developed within IRAS. Long-term goal of DCEP development is the creation of a platform that manages digital data and collaborative development through all phases of a satellite life cycle, from early design to production and operation up to decommissioning. For this, the DCEP platform design is based on a distributed, modular concept, which enables future extensions and additionally provides opportunities for the DCEP to be used for a wide range of other potential applications outside of satellite development. This paper provides an overview of the platform’s concepts, methods and technologies and presents the current state of development as well as planned future steps.

In addition to detecting layer internal defects, layer imaging offers the possibility to retrieve the outer contours of a layer and thus three-dimensionally reconstruct the side walls of a part by vertically stacking contours belonging to sequential layers. The current open challenges for layer imaging relate to the compromise between imaging resolution and extension of covered area, and to the complexity of image interpretation, exacerbated by optically difficult materials, complex filament patterns and non-uniform environmental conditions. In this work we propose an original optical imaging solution for layer contour identification and stacking. Our solution overcomes the current challenges related to range/resolution and image interpretation by making use of digital twins, i.e. geometric simulations of the layer, based on the current manufacturing process parameters. Thanks to the use of digital twins, our vision system is able to: use high-resolution imaging only where it is needed, by following the predicted positions of the layer contours while acquiring a sequence of images; algorithmically interpret each image by concentrating only on interesting regions as suggested by the simulated prediction, thus reducing the risk for false positives; and finally monitor contour quality by performing a more accurate comparison between the measurement and a reference contour obtained by a simulation which replicates the actual fingerprint of the process, as opposed to simply relying on the edge obtained by slicing the CAD model. The in-process monitoring capability of the computer vision system is demonstrated through the fabrication of acceptable and defected instances of a test geometry. Fabrication issues are effectively and efficiently detected by the system and alarms are triggered that can be used to command early termination of the build process or to initiate corrective actions. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Computer Vision; Fused Filament Fabrication; Material extrusion; Process monitoring and control,Computer aided design; Computer aided software engineering; Defects; Digital twin; Fabrication; Geometry; Image analysis; Imaging techniques; Optical image storage; Process control; Process monitoring; Risk assessment; Computer vision system; Environmental conditions; Geometric simulation; High-resolution imaging; Image interpretation; In-process monitoring; Manufacturing process parameters; Optical imaging solution; Computer vision,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85092013764

This approach is based on systematic access to the process of developing urban planning documentation at the pre-design stage of construction.

An information model of the project of planning territory for construction at the stage of urban design is proposed. The content of each layer of the planning territory information model is described in detail. The conceptual BIM model of spatial data for solving design problems of engineering networks is presented in the form of three main blocks. Block 1 is data sources that are taken from the operating system and external sources. Block 2 is data storage in which operational and external sources supply spatial data and metadata. Block 3 is consumers of information that generate requests for data to the means of presenting the information. The BIM structure of the Central Project Database for comprehensive information support of the design of engineering networks is presented. As the study results are shown, a summary plan of engineering networks was made using BIM-based design software and a digital 3D model of the consolidated plan of engineering networks, made using AutoCAD Civil 3D.

A major aspect, and often an obstacle in the implementation of the co-design approach, is the establishment of a centralized data management system. In the past, the data management concept has been approached from different perspectives. Current approaches usually are oriented along the process chain and thus reflect a unidirectional flow of information. Neither the information feedback nor the reaction to adjustments in upstream model steps is supported, which makes continuous collaboration more difficult and at best reduces the co-design approach for continuous data usage. This paper addresses these weaknesses while outlining an integrative data processing concept enabling co-design between the domains of construction and industrial prefabrication. Geometrical information generated during architectural design and construction planning is reused for the production of components, manufacturing-related design adjustments are transferred back into the domain of construction. Changes throughout the entire process are centrally recorded. To ensure independence from the software tools used and to consider their great diversity, data exchange is largely based on standards, namely industry foundation classes and the standard for the exchange of product model data. In order to counteract the sequential processing according to a waterfall model and to support the co-design approach, the industrial prefabrication toolchain, consisting of computer-aided manufacturing software and downstream postprocessors, is largely automated, so that reprocessing of a workpiece for minor geometric adjustments no longer requires any interaction of the production planner. © 2021 Elsevier B.V..

Using the computerized design software Solidworks and Blender, we configured the assembly of a vertical milling machine to use in video game development software such as Unity. With this software, we created a virtual reality application (governed by fundamentals of educational theory) that allowed users to recognize the milling machine's parts and functions and simulate actual interactions. Additionally, with an accessible virtual reality kit, we added a web plugin with similar functions to achieve a greater scope of teaching. Thus, developing a virtual reality application as didactic support and training familiarized students with a vertical milling machine's parts and operations.

Their design differs significantly from the existing reactors in terms of materials used, safety systems, and relative simplicity of design. Software systems for optimizing the layout of fast reactors have been used in the educational process of Moscow Engineering Physics Institute since their introduction (the early 1970s). These programs are characterized by the possibility of obtaining the optimal reactor layout in automatic mode without taking into account the safe termination of emergency modes. I managed to supplement the optimization model with constraints for functionals simulating the accident-free termination of emergency modes (including the anticipated transient without scram). In addition, I managed to improve the software efficiency, which implies reducing the dimension of the problem without compromising the reliability of the results of its solution. Hence, a new optimization system can be used in the educational process. Minimization of the problem dimension is done by (1) combining emergency modes into a small number of groups, (2) reducing the number of functional capabilities describing each of the emergency modes, (3) preliminary analysis of possible neutralizations and exacerbations of emergency modes when they are imposed, (4) ranking emergency modes by the level of danger, (5) using an effective procedure for taking into account scenario uncertainties in the development of emergency modes. © 2021 CEUR-WS.

The timeconsuming step thereby is no longer the production, but the design of the parts. The key to solve this issue is the development of algorithms for automated process-specific design. Currently, the design process for parts fabricated by AM is still characterized by the procedure used for traditional fabrication processes. Several manual steps are necessary, requiring time and expert knowledge. At our institute, a MATLAB integrated design toolbox is developed, trying to overcome these issues. The basic idea is an algorithmic approach to design problems and a direct generation of surface models that can be fabricated in an AM process. It can be used to realize design tools that allow to define parts by their functionality and not by their geometry. In this work, the toolbox is used to create automated design algorithms for individual compliant mechanisms. A novel droplet-based AM process enabling hard/soft multi material printing is used to fabricate the parts. The scope of the software provides a component library of flexure hinges, mechanical connectors, and grippers that are generated from functional descriptions given by the design engineer. Several application examples of compliant mechanisms realized with the software are shown. An experiment is presented showing investigations of how well functional specifications can be reached.

Even when machinery is adopted to support manufacturing operations, in most cases an operator has to supervise or carry out the task. On the other hand, craft footwear industries are called to respond to continuous challenges to face the globalization effects, so that a rapid adaptability to customer needs is required. The industry 4.0 paradigms, which are taking place in the industrial environments, represent an excellent opportunity to improve the efficiency and quality of production, and a way to face international competitors. This paper analyses and proposes a robotic cell to automatize the process of glue deposition on shoe upper, which exploits a new means of depositing the glue compared to State-of-Art applications. While the latter mainly adopt glue gun spraying systems or pneumatic syringes, the proposed robotic cell is based on an extrusion system for the deposition of molten material originally in the form of a filament, similar to all extent to those adopted for Fused Deposition Modeling (FDM). Two cell solutions are designed and tested. In the former the extruder is the robot end effector and the shoe upper is grounded to the cell frame. In the second, being the reciprocal, the shoe last is clamped to the robot wrist and the extruder is fixed to the cell frame. The peculiarities of the two solutions are pointed out and compared in terms of cell layout, hardware, programming software and possibility to develop collaborative applications. A self developed slicing software allows designing the trajectories for glue deposition based on the CAD model of the shoe upper, also allowing driving the inclination of the extruder nozzle with respect to the vectors normal to the upper surface. Both the proposed cell layouts permit to achieve good quality and production times. The solution with the mobile extruder is able to deposit glue at highest end-effector speed (up to 200 mm/s). On the other hand, the solution with the mobile shoe upper and fixed extruder seems to be more appropriate to enhance collaborative applications. © 2020 by the authors.

This fact forces conscious people to take action to fight directly against negative climate change or to promote ecological ideas among others. Many important changes in the world have been pushed through by a large group of people. This implies that a conscious society will run households in environmentally friendly manner and work together to bring about change at the political level. This paper introduces the design, construction and programming of the prototype of the mobile robot, which will be able to clean up urban green areas in the future. For the best possible result, the entire trucked suspension was designed from scratch and then fabricated with rapid prototyping. The working prototype of the robot acts as a proof of concept and has basic functionality. A very significant inspiration for this project is the “Wall-e” movie (Disney, Pixar), which tells a story about an adorable cleaning mobile robot. The problem of rubbish on the streets, in the film as in our reality, is just the tip of the iceberg, but it is visible in every corner of the world, here and now. A cleaning robot can turn out to be an ideal platform for the exchange of information between environmentalists and the common man. Before 3D printing procedure, an accurate Computer Aided Design (CAD) model of the robot has been designed as well as electronic and standardized elements have been selected. After the assembly operations, the result was a functioning prototype visually referring to the movie hero Wall-e. This took a first step in a larger cleaning robot project – Wall-e 2.0. The prototype has simple input and output devices that make it easier for users to program and implement new functionalities. The whole thing is controlled by the popular Arduino Uno microcontroller. The current program of the robot bases on a primitive state machine with the possibility of remote control or automatic driving. In conclusion, a plan for further development has been outlined as an important part of the paper. © 2021 International Multidisciplinary Scientific Geoconference.

QuickSAT/Designer with the open source step_SATdb data architecture is a model-based satellite design, mission planning, and product lifecycle management environment. Satellite design encompasses a multitude of steps from concept to flight. Mission specification to flight can typically take several years, depending on the scope, requirements and budget of the mission. The process also requires a wide range of design and management tools that have limited consistency, limited data interchange capability, and a lack of coherency. Detailing the relationships between the satellite configuration inventory control systems, life cycle management, design, analysis and test data is difficult at best. Research has focused on our Satellite Design Automation architecture QuickSAT/Designer Release 2, in conjunction with our step_SATdb open database architecture, to meet this need. step_SATdb seamlessly integrates existing detail design tools with QuickSAT, as well as databases tracking requirements, hardware and software components and payloads in inventory with the final configuration of the satellite. QuickSAT/Designer with the Configurator AI based toolset, provides for rapid design, and integration with existing design tools, and provides coherency between a range of applications and data sets. QuickSAT/Designer utilizes model-based design processes, techniques and methodologies to develop conceptual designs with expedient leveraging of the best new commercially-available and open source tools. Recent research focused developing and enhancing the rapid space mission design capability, and demonstrating the utility in several customer need areas for missions that are at different stages of conceptual maturity, including where conceptual development has not yet begun.

Such operations as union, intersection, subtraction are performed over layers that contain orthogonal polygons. These operations are subject to stringent execution time requirements. The traditional representation of polygons in the form of bitmaps does not provide a quasi-linear dependence of time on the processed data size and requires development of new algorithms and polygon representation approaches. This paper contains a description of a modified sweeping line obscuring algorithm that achieves O(N log N) time. The algorithm uses three properties of the polygon: the separation of inner region from outer region by the edge, the belonging of edges to the set of either vertical or horizontal edges, and dissection of the layer plane into rectangular fragments which belong to either inner or outer region of the polygon. Procedures of input polygon contour representations that are dissected into sets of vertical and horizontal edges are described. As a result of performing logical operations, polygon edges of the resulting layer are formed. These edges, in turn, are converted into contour representations. The results of a computational experiment confirming the nature of the time dependences determined theoretically are presented.

In the 19th century, master builders merged the responsibilities of engineers and architects. During that period, both fields progressed with the focus on art and technique. Moreover, the present digitalization of our environment has changed the profession once again and has created the field of Parametric Design and Engineering, where engineers adapt the main themes of architecture and computer science. Contemporary software technologies have changed almost every industry sector and will change the way of structural design, as well as the possibility for engineers to build smarter, cheaper and more efficiently. This paper presents the development of an interactive structural design algorithm for round timber 2D trusses. The aim was to eliminate disadvantages of conventional design methods, such as iterative workflows, erroneous pre-designs, non-optimized structural performance capacities or high workloads with the creation of an automated digital value-chain for multiple CAD- and FEM-ready solutions, including component cost libraries and multi-objective optimization processes. © WCTE 2021.

In AEDT’s aircraft performance modeling and simulation, the recent addition of Base of Aircraft Data (BADA) family 4 methods and data raised AEDT’s functional and fidelity capability to a new level. Meanwhile, the implementation of BADA4 models also brought additional needs for an uncertainty quantification effort in order to better understand the main contributors to AEDT output variations under BADA4, and inform developers about future enhancement directions for AEDT performance. In this paper we present the first stage of the uncertainty quantification effort on BADA4. First, the uncertainty characterization step identifies and mathematically representing the uncertain parameters, including BADA4 model coefficients and physical/operational parameters. Subsequently, a sensitivity analysis quantifies the impacts of physical/operational uncertainties on key AEDT outputs.

Furthermore, making such a design approach suitable for real-time embedded systems requires the need for extending the standard DPR design flow with additional design steps, which have to accurately account for the timing behavior of the software and hardware components of the design, as well as of the components of the computing platform (e.g., the reconfiguration interface). To address this problem, this paper presents DART, a tool that fully automates the design flow in a real-time DPR-based system that comprises both software and hardware components. The tool targets the Zynq 7-series and Ultrascale+ FPGA-based SoCs by Xilinx. It aims at alleviating the manual effort required by state-of-the-art tools while not expecting high expertise in the design of programmable logic components under DPR. To this purpose, it fully automates the partitioning, floorplanning, and implementation (routing and bitstream generation) phases, generating a set of bitstreams starting from a set of tasks annotated with high-level timing requirements. The tool leverages mathematical optimization to solve the partitioning and floorplanning problems, and relies on a set of auto-generated scripts that interact with the vendor tools to mobilize the synthesis and implementation stages.

Design/methodology/approach: Cognitive analytics management (CAM) framework (Osman and Anouz, 2014) is used. Cognitive process: The right questions are asked to understand the behavior of every process and the flow of its corresponding data; critical data variables were identified, guidelines for identifying data sources were set. Analytics process: Techniques of data analytics were applied to the selected data sets, problems were identified in user–system interaction and in the system design. The analysis process helped the management in the management process to make right decisions for the right change. Findings: Using the CAM framework, the analysis to the Lebanese Red Cross case study identified system user-behavior problems and also system design problems. It identified cases where distributed subsystems are vulnerable to time keeping errors and helped the management make knowledgeable decisions to overcome major obstacles by implementing several changes related to hardware design, software implementation, human resource training, operational and human-technology changes. CAM is a novel and feasible software engineering approach for handling system failures. Originality/value: The paper uses CAM framework as an approach to overcome system failures and help management do the needed changes to enhance such a critical process. This work contributes to the software engineering literature by introducing CAM as a new agile methodology to be used when dealing with system failures. Furthermore, this study is an action research that validated the CAM theoretical framework in a health emergency context in Lebanon. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Action research; Clock drift; Cognitive analytics management; Emergency management dispatch; Time synchronization,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85100300368

The influences of nonlinear (second-order approximation) geometry are realistically incorporated using an AISC 2010 direct analysis method. The optimization minimizes the total weight of structures subjected to the challenges associated with the simultaneous presence of nonlinear design formulations and discrete design variables realistically considering the availability of standard steel sections. This leads to a non-convex and/or non-smooth optimization program. The ESO algorithm overcomes the problem by performing iterative elimination procedures of ineffective sections, where the feasible design domain progressively converges to the minimum distribution of steel members satisfying limit state (ultimate strength and serviceability) criteria. The ESO design process is encoded within a visual basis application (VBA) framework having a direct interface with the commercial analysis and design software, called SAP2000.

In the casting industry software tools for 3D CAD, material data, structural analysis, nondestructive testing (NDT) and durability analysis are used. They are parts in the numerical process chain developing cast components, in which various information must be exchanged. The simplest form of the process chain is the linear flow. However, it reaches its full performance only with the methods of Simultaneous Engineering (SE). The overlapping of workflows is the characteristic feature of the SE and requires fast and robust communication between software tools. Currently, the numerical process chain in the casting industry is missing some interfaces between important software packages. As a first step the paper proposes an automatic acceptor generator as a solution to address this challenge. The acceptor generator only requires the syntactic definition to check the data format of an input file. The method is based on the syntax description of file formats as an application of context-free grammars (CFG). In this context using the extended Backus-Naur form (EBNF) notation a file format can be completely syntactically defined. As a proof of concept for the acceptor generator, the data output of a material simulation is checked for syntactic correctness. The conversion information added by syntactic description might be used for development an interface between the material and structural simulation software package. The only requirements will be the EBNF description of the grammar as well as the conversion information. The procedure based on this general approach will close the gaps in the numerical process chain. It can be used to implement other missing interfaces between software tools, too. © 2021 IEEE.",acceptor generator; EBNF; metalanguage; process chain; simulation; simultaneous engineering; Software interface,Computer aided design; Computer aided software engineering; Durability; Nondestructive examination; Software packages; Syntactics; Acceptor generator; Casting industry; Extended backus-naur form; Metalanguage; Numerical process; Process chain; Simulation; Simulation software package; Software interfaces; Software-tools; Software testing,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85116665852

Although CXR is a relatively effective and inexpensive method for TB screening and triaging, a shortage of skilled radiologists in many high TB-burden countries limits its use. CAD technology offers a solution to this problem. Before adopting a CAD product, TB programmes need to consider not only the diagnostic accuracy but also implementation-relevant features including operational characteristics, deployment mechanism, input and machine compatibility, output format, options for integration into the legacy system, costs, data sharing and privacy aspects, and certification. A landscaping analysis was conducted to collect this information among CAD developers known to have or soon to have a TB product. The responses were reviewed and finalized with the developers, and are published on an open-access website: www.ai4hlth.org. CAD products are constantly being improved and the site will continuously be updated to account for updates and new products. This unique online resource aims to inform the TB community about available CAD tools, their features and set-up procedures, to enable TB programmes to identify the most suitable product to incorporate in interventions. © 2021 The Authors",Artificial intelligence; Chest X-ray; Computer automated detection; Deep learning; Diagnostic; Tuberculosis,"Automation; Deep Learning; Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted; Diffusion of Innovation; Host-Pathogen Interactions; Humans; Lung; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; Predictive Value of Tests; Radiographic Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Radiography, Thoracic; Reproducibility of Results; Software; Tuberculosis, Pulmonary; algorithm; Article; artificial intelligence; certification; deep learning; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic test accuracy study; human; image analysis; priority journal; questionnaire; registration; screening; thorax radiography; tuberculosis; automation; computer assisted diagnosis; diagnostic imaging; host pathogen interaction; lung; lung tuberculosis; mass communication; microbiology; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; pathogenicity; predictive value; reproducibility; software; thorax radiography",Article,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85099203279

For maintenance purposes, it is so vital to dismount cases and remove components in a short time. In classical cases, mobile recorders, time delay relay contacts, hard drives and power converters, poe card, recorder cards are mounted to the body of case by opening holes to the front-back panel and inside of the case and screwing cards to the cases. This study mainly focuses on developing a case without any screws and soldering. Components and cards can be mounted to the case with a click system. The projected case prevents from soldering errors, the jamming during removal of the hard disk, easing for both remote monitoring and re-opening the case by the end user in case of the insertion of a sim card for the internet. In this study, two molds are designed and manufactured using CAD software and classical subtractive manufacturing techniques. Two molds were designed and manufactured for using in extrusion process of aluminum and plastics materials. Aluminum and plastic parts were produced with extrusion machine. The cards were mounted to the case by clicking. This study improved production processes, reduced both soldering amounts in developing electronic cards and the cost & time delay. It also increased the efficiency, reduced product loss and idle/die change times, provided user convenience, and shortened production time. © 2021, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Mobile recorder; Mold; Poe card; Power converters; Taylor-made electronic card design; Time delay relay module,,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85096502674

Concepts such as simultaneous engineering aim for a product creation process, which addresses both, functional requirements as well as requirements from production. However, existing concepts mostly focus on organizational tasks and heavily rely on the human factor for the exchange of complex information across different domains, organizations or systems. Nowadays product and process design make use of advanced software tools such as computer-aided design, manufacturing and engineering systems (CAD/CAM/CAE). Modern systems already provide a seamless integration of both worlds in a single digital environment to ensure a continuous workflow. Yet, for the holistic harmonization between product and process design, the following aspects are missing: • The digital environment does not provide a complete and data consistent digital twin of the component; this applies especially to the process design and analysis environment • Due to the lack of process and part condition data in the manufacturing environment an adaptation of product and process design for a balanced functionality and manufacturability is hindered • Systematic long-term data analytics across different product and process designs with the ultimate goal to transfer knowledge from one product to the next and to accelerate the entire product development process is not considered This paper presents an exploration concept which couples product design (CAD), process design (CAM), process simulation (CAE) and process adaptation in a single software system. The approach provides insights into correlations and dependencies between input parameters of product/process design and the process output. The insights potentially allow for a knowledge-based adaptation, tackling well-known optimization issues such as parameter choice or operation sequencing. First results are demonstrated using the example of a blade integrated disk (blisk).

Assembly workers are exposed to increased process complexity resulting in physical and cognitive workload. Worker guidance systems (WGS) are used to overcome this challenge through output of information regarding what should be done, how it should be done and why it should be done. An unsolved scientific challenge in this context is efficient information supply of WGS. Information such as worker’s instruction texts, pictures or 3D representations are created by employees of the work preparation department and transferred to the WGS. Manual information supply is a time-consuming and complex process, which requires a high (non-value-adding) effort as well as comprehensive knowledge in handling 3D CAD modelling and software programming. This paper presents a novel approach to reduce the required manual effort in information supply process. A knowledge-based model is proposed that enables an automated information supply of WGS in smart assembly environment by means of algorithms and self-learning expert systems, which pursues a holistic and consistent approach without media breaks. The automated approach assists employees of work preparation department, which means they can concentrate on their essential core competencies instead of being busy, for example, creating assembly plans, instruction texts or pictures for individual WGS.

The popularity of DHM usage in product development is increasing, and many companies take advantage of DHM in their virtual prototyping studies. However, DHM is usually interpreted as a post-conceptualization check gate methodology and is often applied to correct ergonomics assumptions. Although this approach provides some insight into product performance, designers often miss more widespread opportunities in terms of utilizing DHM as an early design stage design tool. This research presents our ongoing efforts in developing DHM-based early design computational Human Factors Engineering (HFE) support tools. We engage this reflection by summarizing two early design frameworks emerging from our recent work: (1) Prototyping Toolbox and (2) Human Error and Functional Failure Reasoning (HEFFR). These frameworks are originated from the Digital Human-in-the-loop (DHIL) methodology. DHIL proposes a simulation-based computational design methodology that builds a bridge between existing Computer-Aided Engineering (CAE) software packages and computational HFE tools to address safety, comfort, and performance-related issues early in design. Our primary focus in this paper is to demonstrate the frameworks emerging from our recent D-HIL research to promote better early design decision-making for human-centered product design. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Digital Human Modeling; Engineering design; Ergonomics; Fault modeling; Human Factors Engineering; Human-centered design,Bridges; Computer aided engineering; Computer aided software engineering; Computer software; Decision making; Ergonomics; Health risks; Risk management; Safety engineering; Computational design; Computational strategy; Design capacity; Digital human modeling; Early design decisions; Early design stages; Functional failure; Product performance; Product design,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85112226526

The study examines for the modern era issues first developed and reconciled by the Robotic Lunar Surface Operations (RLSO) study published in 1990 and resurrected at the 69th IAC in Bremen. The new study updates key assumptions for 1) resources - lunar polar ice instead of ilmenite; 2) solar power - polar lighting conditions instead of the 28-day equatorial lunation cycle; 3) transportation - use of multiple flight systems now in development and planning; 4) base site planning - a range of options near, straddling, and inside permanently shadowed regions; 5) ISRU scenarios - for harvesting ice and for constructing radiation shielding from regolith. As did the original study, RLSO2 combines US experts in mission design, space architecture, robotic surface operations, autonomy, ISRU, operations analysis, and human space mission and lunar surface experience. Unlike the original study, the new study uses contemporary tools: CAD engineering of purpose-design base elements, and integrated performance captured in a numerical operations model. This allows rapid iteration to converge system sizing, and builds a legacy analysis tool that can assess the performance benefits and impacts of any proposed system element in the context of the overall base. The paper presents an overview of the ground rules, assumptions, methodology, operations model, element designs, base site plan, and quantitative findings. These findings include the performance of various regolith and ice resource utilization schemes as a function of base location and lunar surface parameters.

In this context, the Roofline model proposes an intuitive and visual method providing performance insight and optimization guidance for a given architecture. Although this methodology successfully models multicore and GPU performance optimizations, the original formulation does not directly apply to FPGA devices. For this reason, we propose a Roofline model analysis for reconfigurable architectures and an associated CAD tool for assisting HLS optimization of C/C++ applications. We firstly model FPGA attainable performance by means of an analytical method. Then, we integrate locality walls and a DSE engine for an enhanced optimization process. Starting from a software version of the N-body algorithm, we firstly illustrate how our methodology helps at quickly achieving performance comparable to a state-of-the-art FPGA bespoke implementation. Then, we illustrate an assisted platform porting of the Smith-Waterman sequence alignment providing a 9x speedup. Finally, we evaluated the single DSE engine on the Poly-Bench test suite and achieved performance improvements up to 14.36x compared to previous automated solutions in the literature. © 2020 Association on Computer Machinery.",CAD; DSE; FPGA; High-Performance Computing; Roofline Model,C++ (programming language); Engines; Field programmable gate arrays (FPGA); Reconfigurable architectures; Analytical method; Application performance; Automated solutions; Computing system; Performance optimizations; Sequence alignments; Software versions; Structured method; Computer aided logic design,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85097960824

The AUTOSAR methodology has two main activities: system configuration and the Electronic Control Unit (ECU) configuration. The system configuration is the mapping of the software components to the ECUs based on the system requirements. The ECU configuration (EC) process is an important part of the ECU software integration and generation. ECU-specific information is extracted from the system configuration description, and all the necessary information for the implementation such as tasks, scheduling, and assignments of the runnables to tasks and configuration of the Basic Software (BSW) modules are performed. The EC process involves configuring every single module of the AUTOSAR. Due to the high complexity and redundancy of this process, it has to be supported by different tool-related editors that can automatically generate source files like *.c and *.h for the configuration. In this paper, we propose a method to automate the EC process for AUTOSAR. We use Module Configuration Templates (MCT) written in Xtend programming language along with a BSW configuration source code generator (BSG) Computer-Aided Design (CAD) tool developed at APAG Elektronik. This tool can extract the configuration parameters and automatically generate the required ECU module configuration. The watchdog module will be used as an example to generate and integrate the EC. This enables the seamless generation of the software configurations from the system-level requirements to the software implementation and therefore ensures consistency, correctness, and cost efficiency and reduces the work done by the developer to generate the configuration.  © 2021 SAE International.

A difficult challenge is generating game design ideas for a given behaviour change brief. This paper describes a card design tool that supports ideas generation. Each card summarises a behaviour change technique (BCT), provides an application example prompt, and identifies possible game design elements. The research question is: does the card design tool have perceived value for designers for generating ideas for behaviour change games? To evaluate the tool, four recently graduated game design students were given a set of 34 cards, instructions on using the cards, a game brief and then asked to generate ideas. The instructions included sorting the cards into piles with different headings (BCT, application example prompt, game design element). Cards were drawn randomly one at a time from each pile iteratively until all piles were exhausted. Participants recorded ideas using techniques they felt comfortable with e.g. note-taking, mind maps. Qualitative data on the students' perceived value of the design tool was collected using semi-structured interviews and analysed using reflexive thematic analysis. It showed that the cards had some value for ideas generation but often had too much information thereby stifling creativity. Some instructions were also confusing. The cards were modified: information made more succinct and a visual guide added to provide clearer instruction. The experiment was repeated with four serious games academics with more game design experience. Similar qualitative data was collected and analysed. This showed that the design tool provided a framework for designers to organise their initial ideas about how different elements of the game design brief might be tackled. It also helped to identify knowledge gaps and ideas that needed to be developed further. However, there remain some concerns about the tool's complexity inhibiting aspects of creative flow. © The Authors, 2021.

It is termed as the ability of a ship to return to its upright position, when disturbed. However, this study explicitly aims to focus on determining only the intact stability of the vessel, as a part of general concept of ship's seaworthiness. Specifically, it investigates the intact stability of the model hull form at large angles of inclinations because the metacenter's position does not remain fixed, dissimilar to the instance of small heel angles. In this context, previously used approximate approaches are discussed and in addition to that, an analytical approach has additionally been contrived. This analytical approach relies on the cross curves of stability (KN curves) for formation of statical curves of stability (GZ curves), which is the measure of large angle stability of a vessel. With the aid of this approach, a code has been composed using MATLAB programming language to compute the intact stability of a vessel via offset data provided. The point to ponder here is that this program does calculations without any dependency on a 3D model. The results of this code are extracted in graphical form i.e. body plan, hydrostatic curves and GZ curve, and these results are further on validated using marine design software. On this premise, it is concluded that the analytical approach taken for calculations is appropriate and thus, the GZ curves formed are accurate.  © 2021 IEEE.",GZ; heel; Hydrostatic; KN; MATLAB; Metacenter,3D modeling; Hydraulics; MATLAB; Ships; Analytical approach; Angle stability; Body plan; Design softwares; Graphical forms; Hull forms; Intact stability; Upright position; Stability,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85104623414

The amount of earthwork volumes therefore earthwork cost, mostly depends on the geometry of the road vertical alignment. We can conclude that an optimized vertical alignment has a profound impact on earthwork costs. In this research paper, we solve the task connected to the minimization of earthwork cost by optimizing vertical alignment by the development of linear optimization model with different categories of unknown variables including vertical offsets between road and surface in different points as well as extremum points' numbers. Proposed linear optimization model is supposed to be implemented with application of simplex method as the component of complex branch and bound approach. The developed model has been implemented on the basis of practical example.

Availability and use of different computer-aided design (CAD) tools in the market made this concept generation process longer and time-consuming due to its limitation on detailing and editing. As an alternative, freehand sketching is very quick and easily editable which focuses on quantity rather than quality which allows healthy discussion and quick adjustment towards a valid and relevant design proposal. To explore learner's (students') experiences of concept ideation while studying product design and development, different freehand sketching tools were introduced like the use of some software instead of just traditional pen and paper kind of freehand sketching during the start of the trimester to quickly represent their ideas amongst their peers. During the later part of detail design, they used CAD tools. In this paper, a few examples are provided to show students' freehand sketching skills during concept ideation and the use of CAD tools for detailed design drawing. The effectiveness of this approach is measured through a survey conducted for students at the end of the trimester and it has been evaluated based on the survey results. They were asked to give responses based on their experience during the trimester. The results suggest that it is very important to emphasize the use of freehand sketching during concept ideation and the utility of CAD tools at the detail design stage of the product design development to achieve the learning outcomes of the module of Design and Manufacture 1 at the University of Glasgow, Singapore (UGS).  © 2021 IEEE.",CAD tool; concept ideation; development; freehand sketching; product design,Availability; Computer aided design; Students; Surveys; Computer aided design tools; Computer-aided design; Concept ideation; Design development; Detail design; Development; Engineering product development; Freehand sketching; Learner's experience; Product-development cycles; Product design,Conference paper,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85125928616

The application of this software allows to develop products from scratch, or to investigate the static and dynamic behavior of multibody models with remarkable precision. In order to keep the development costs low for highly sophisticated products, more precisely motorcycle rider assistance systems, it is necessary to focus extensively on the virtual prototyping using different software tools. In general, the interconnection of different tools is rather difficult, especially when considering the coupling of a detailed multibody model with a simulation software like MATLAB Simulink. The aim of this paper is to demonstrate the performance of a motorcycle rider assistance algorithm using a cosimulation approach between the free multibody software called FreeDyn and Simulink based on a sophisticated multibody motorcycle model. This multibody model is coupled with Simulink and a suitable motorcycle rider assistance system is developed based on a systematic control approach, ensuring that the motorcycle performs a specified maneuver. For this rider assistance algorithm two different feedback approaches are employed, making use of the frozen-time method and a time-variant approach. Due to the high complexity of the multibody model, the rider design is based on a reduced order nonlinear motorcycle model, that captures the most important dynamics of the sophisticated model. The final cosimulation provides a highly satisfying performance, demonstrating the successful application for a sophisticated multibody model. Compared to commercially available software products for motorcycle dynamics, FreeDyn is a free alternative software tool, which is not restricted to developing motorcycle models, as it is suitable for various multibody applications. Hence, this cosimulation approach creates new opportunities for cost-effective virtual prototyping concepts.  © 2020 SAE International.

The software consists of two parts: the experiment control software and the experiment design tools. The first corresponds to the software running on the payload and is in charge of controlling and executing the experiments, while the latter are the tools used by the scientists to create the experiment definition that will be later uploaded to the instrument to be executed. To overcome the challenge of developing software with such complexity, it was decided to follow a model-driven development approach. Several domain-specific languages (DSLs) have been created to allow scientists to describe their experiments in a domain-specific way. These descriptions are then uploaded and executed by different interpreters onboard.

The fast growth in the urban population is a serious concern for city administration. It leads to various challenges while handling problems of resource crunch and managing them. Developments that relate to smart cities are helping the administration address these problems. Its initial effort prediction and its scalability are the main features for the completion of a successful smart-city project. The initiative depends on many factors that are inter-related. It is not possible to change or optimise certain kinds of aspects separately. The last-minute change in the schedule raises the project budget and time. In the early phases of the project, a realistic and concrete project plan needs a fair estimate of effort. This projected effort helps to monitor and handle the activities of application creation by the developer. Unfair allocation of efforts and resources between development activities, including software projects, contributes to the failure of smart city projects, too. Therefore, for smart city ventures, the secret to success is an accurate estimation of implementation activities at the earliest. Numerous approaches are available for effort prediction of software as well as hardware projects used to develop the smart city projects. Hence, the gap in the different methods available creates thrust areas for researchers to investigate and propose an effort prediction model for smart city-based projects. In this paper, a model has been formulated that takes into consideration a set of critical factors for a given IoT based application used to develop smart city in the subject, and it further provides estimation for the effort. © 2021 Institute of Physics Publishing.

While designing software ecosystems, platform providers face an overwhelming design space of business and technical architectural decisions. Usually, enterprise architecture modeling languages such as ArchiMate are used to design the ecosystem around the platforms. Despite a body of work studying architecture of software ecosystems, there is still a lack of a reference architecture that captures both business and technical aspects, which can be followed by platform providers to design these systems. In this paper, we develop a reference architecture by using different sources of information such as existing ecosystems and the literature. After identifying the shortcomings of the ArchiMate language to design software ecosystems, we extend the language using the reference architecture to enable direct and enhanced modeling of ecosystem-specific concepts. The extended ArchiMate has been implemented in a tool that we use to design a real-world ecosystem called F-Droid. Our results show the reference architecture captures the F-Droid ecosystem architecture. Bad architectural smells are detected, and improvement suggestions are made.

There are many sheet metal combination parts applications facing the die designer. This kind of die design considers one of the most complicated designs in the tool room. There are many classifications of sheet metal parts can be arranged under the combination die, one of them is the cupping and punching dies. In this paper, a classification of cupping and punching die types into groups and computer aided design for parametric design of combination dies are discussed.

The development of ACPUT was inspired by the observation that although modern computer-aided design (CAD) / computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) systems can automatically create CAM programs, their universality makes them both difficult to use and inefficient because the programs created this way often contain errors. The presented programming procedure includes the development of specific machining templates based on technological knowledge gathered in a specially prepared database. These templates are dedicated to a group of parts characterized by the similarity of their geometric features. ACPUT makes it possible to reduce(in comparison to traditional CAM programming) the time required to develop a machining program, thereby positively impacting the total cost of tooling production. The paper aims to present results of testing the effectiveness of the use of ACPUT by technicians with different levels of experience (expert and beginner).

Therefore, a good user experience is fundamental for their success in the market. Companies employ highly specialized people in front-end development and User Experience (UX) User Interface (UI) design to achieve this goal. Their collaboration is critical and raises some efficiency challenges, particularly in Low-Code platforms, such as OutSystems. UX/UI designers typically use specialized tools with their underlying metamodels. OutSystems developers use an integrated development environment with the underlying OutSystems metamodel. While there are some code-generation plugins for popular design tools, these do not generate code for Low-Code platforms. The current transformation process from design to development is done 100% manually, resulting in a loss of efficiency. Our goal is to accelerate this transformation process from a design model to a development model to mitigate this inefficiency. To do so, we developed an approach using model transformations to automate part of the process. Namely, it automates the generation of application pages/screens by composing the screen mockups in a design technology (such as Figma or Sketch) with a library of reusable UI components to instantiate the design in a front-end technology (such as OutSystems). Our approach was validated by a professional team of frontend developers from an established enterprise-grade Low-Code platform who applied and evaluated this work on some of their past real projects. Preliminary results show an overall acceptance of the developed tool with a possible increase of 150% to 400% in the number of pages/screens that they can deliver with the same effort. This approach allows mitigating a bottleneck faced by the development team. To increase the value they could offer to customers (e.g., by producing more application screens in the same time frame), they would need to recruit new collaborators whose skill set is high on demand. Our work offers a more economical alternative to increase their productivity. © 2021 IEEE.",Automation; Design To Code; Front-end Development; Generation; Low-Code Platforms; OutSystems,Automation; Codes (symbols); Computer software reusability; Design; Efficiency; Design to code; Front end; Front-end development; Generation; Interface designers; Low-code platform; Meta model; Outsystem; Transformation process; Users' experiences; User interfaces,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85124004703

The problems of warpage due to thermal stresses, non-uniform pressure distribution around cavities, shrinkage, sticking and overall products quality are some of the important challenges. The main objective of this work is to analyze the stress distribution around the cavities during the molding and demolding to avoid their effects on the product quality. Moreover, diagnosing the critical pressure points around and overall the cavity projection area, which is subjected to high pressure will help to determine the optimum pressure distribution and ensure filling all cavities at the same time, which is another significant objective. Computer-aided design (CAD) and CATIA V5R20 are adopted for design and modeling procedures. The computer-aided engineering (CAE) commercial software ABAQUS 6141 has been dedicated as finite element simulation packages for the analysis of this process. Simulation results show that stress distribution over the cavities depends on both pressure and temperature gradient over the contact surfaces and can be considered as the main affecting factor. The acceptable ranges of the cavity stresses were determined according to the following values: the cavity and core region temperature of 55–65 °C, filling time of 10–20 s, ejection pressure 0.85 % of injection pressure, and holding time of 10–15 s. Also, theoretical results reveal that the uniform pressure and temperature distribution can be controlled by adjusting the cavities layout, runner, and gate size. Moreover, the simulation process shows that it is possible to facilitate and identify many difficulties during the process and modify the prototype to evaluate the overall manufacturability before further investing in tooling. Furthermore, it is also concluded that tooling iterations will be minimized according to the design of the selected process © 2021. Authors.

Since the 70s, the design process has changed due to the new technologies and tools related to Computer-Aided Design software and Virtual Reality applications that make almost the whole process digital. However, the concept phase of the design process is still based on traditional approaches, while digital tools are poor exploited. In this phase, designers need tools that allow them to rapidly save and freeze their ideas, such as sketching on paper, which is not integrated in the digital-based process. The paper presents a new gestural interface to give designers more support by introducing an effective device for 3D modelling to improve and speed up the conceptual design process. We designed a set of gestures to allow people from different background to 3D model their ideas in a natural way. A testing session with 17 participants allowed us to verify if the proposed interaction was intuitive or not. At the end of the tests, all participants succeeded in the 3D modelling of a simple shape (a column) by only using air gestures in a relatively short amount of time exactly how they expected it to be built, confirming the proposed interaction.

With the popularization of computer technology, people pay more and more attention to the progress of the times brought by science and technology, and begin to strengthen the application of computer technology. Among them, people pay special attention to processing design works in the field of art with computers, and at the same time, computer technology has greatly improved people's aesthetic standards. Contemporary art majors pay more and more attention to design details, but those design details and sense of design can't be expressed by traditional painting techniques to a great extent. However, with the development of current social science and technology, computer Photoshop software can realize drawing details, which makes art design works more aesthetic and visual appeal. Therefore, using Photoshop computer design software has become an indispensable course in contemporary art design majors. Photoshop software contains many design elements, which can help students to better mix colors, thus expanding students' awareness of aesthetic art and improving their artistic appreciation ability. This paper mainly explores the application of Photoshop computer software in contemporary art design. Firstly, it analyzes the common functions of Photoshop software. Secondly, it explores the main application fields of Photoshop computer design software in art design. Finally, it summarizes the positive and negative effects of Photoshop software on art design, and puts forward suggestions for improvement. © 2021 IEEE.",application exploration; contemporary art design; Photoshop computer design software,Application programs; Arts computing; Curricula; Design; Economic and social effects; Industrial informatics; Social sciences computing; Application fields; Computer designs; Computer technology; Painting techniques; Photoshop - computer software; Positive and negative effect; Processing design; Science and Technology; Software design,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85105329335

From the studies in this field have resulted in new calculation methods and energy and characteristics physical environment assessment. Energy research developed in parallel with distributed computational capabilities and the software that allowed them to automate not only the calculations but also parametric simulations. A chronological summary of this evolution is illustrated with references to the main modeling and energy simulation software. Some experimental projects developed over the last 20 years are presented, demonstrating the state of the art of Green Design with evidence relating to the actual performance in use conditions. In advanced areas such as the development of tertiary buildings and terminals, the three areas of sustainability are combined to obtain more sustainable projects not only on an environmental basis but also on economic and social ones. The phenomena are driven by market and management needs; it is evidenced by the increase in standards and life cycle certifications aimed not only at products but also at the overall management of the project and activities over the life cycle. With the evolution of CAD towards BIM platforms since the second half of the 1950s, the possibility of creating interoperable platforms useful for various purposes has opened up: in a first phase, it was possible to import data processed by specialized software and subsequently to integrate them into the field of modeling. With the perspectives opened by platforms on the web, a new way of designing and producing is started, fully compatible with the digital environment. Introducing these types of innovation that enable the full digitalization of processes appears to be the most plausible operating scenario for Green Design as it allows the connection and implementation of lean and efficient management of the project-production chain in all phases of the cycle of life and in perspective to create new project areas aimed at the digital construction of buildings directly from the digital model (Digital Twin). © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",,,Book chapter,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85101082321

Digital assignments were separate from the customary pencil & paper homework given once a week. The primary objective was to model the flow and heat transfer in a system, reinforce theoretical concepts, and allow study of more complex two- and three-dimensional problems. Students encounter fluid flow and heat transfer in the sophomore course, Thermodynamics I, for the first time. Velocity, pressure and temperature fields are quite complicated even for simple geometries, hard to visualize, and difficult to understand. Digital assignments go beyond basic theoretical concepts and relatively simple pencil & paper problems. Initially, there were 6 digital assignments in each course. After the first offerings and assessments, the number of assignments is expected to grow to 8-10. Scaffolding of digital assignments ensured that simulations gain in complexity as students become more familiar with both the theoretical underpinnings and the software interface. Our Mechanical Engineering program, has a freshmen graphic communication course incorporating AutoCAD and a junior CAD course with SolidWorks and Ansys. This provided both a challenge and an opportunity for lecture-based thermofluids courses positioned in between. Modern computational skills were obtained outside the classroom, and that was accomplished with effective use of an on-line environment. Ansys Fluent was chosen to present and reinforce thermo-fluids fundamentals. Each digital assignment had a mesh, detailed grading criteria, and supplementary documentation. Students worked on the: (1) problem set up in the preprocessor-stage, (2) solver, and (3) postprocessor. This approach helped students (1) understand the flow and heat transfer inside the system as well 1 Contact author: milanovic@hartford.edu as the application of conservation of mass and energy, (2) understand and interpret results by comparing them with theoretical and experimental data, (3) develop modern technical skills relevant to the demands of Industry 4.0, and (4) develop research capabilities. Simulations in the classroom and as digital assignments are a representation of the real world, and provide an egalitarian and unrestricted way for students to interact with it, acquiring skills and an appreciation for subject matter as well as the engineering profession. Semester long discussions on various aspects of digital assignments help develop a mentor-mentee bond. This approach to teaching, research and mentoring does not depend on access to laboratory facilities and funding that can reach only a limited number of students. It encourages students spirit of inquiry, and ultimately leads to a professional development opportunities beyond the classroom setting. © 2021 American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME).

As a result, many commercially available computer aided design (CAD) software packages now include TO capabilities. Topology optimization can produce designs with superior performance by optimally allocating a budget of material within a given design domain, but the geometric complexity associated with many TO generated solutions makes realizing these designs via traditional (e.g. subtractive) manufacturing processes quite challenging. Additive manufacturing (AM) processes can effectively realize TO generated designs, but AM is not yet a universally acceptable manufacturing option for many applications. This paper presents the details of a more generally applicable design framework for using commercially available TO tools and an iterative procedure to create structurally optimized designs that are also manufacturable. This iterative process uses a TO solution to a structural design problem generated by a commercial CAD package as a target solution, and then successively adds optimally sized traditionally manufacturable features to the original structure until the engineering performance of the component is as close to the TO generated target design as possible in a multiobjective sense. This approach was tested on a two-dimensional structural design case study to demonstrate its implementation, effectiveness, and general applicability to wide variety of structural design problems.

Many local industries which do not maintain full-time electronics development staff have demanded that electrical engineering graduates support small-scale custom electronic development efforts, and projects that previously would have been contracted are increasingly handled internally. The same developments that have driven demand for custom electronics in industry have made it flexible and affordable to deliver a project-based PCB design course in a single semester. Grand Valley State University (GVSU) offers an electrical engineering senior elective course covering project specification, software/firmware development, CAD layout, PCB fabrication, surface-mount (SMT) assembly, circuit testing, remediation, integration, and packaging. Over the course of a semester, student teams design, assemble, test, package, and demonstrate unique embedded system projects. This paper presents the benefits and challenges of teaching and administering a design-build-test embedded system project course in electrical engineering and addresses plans for ongoing improvement. The course instructs students in each element of an electronics development project. This starts with recognizing electronics problems, specifying critical design functionalities, identifying constraints, anticipating risks and failure modes, and designing for test and remediation. During the course, students receive instruction in proper firmware coding techniques, common electronic circuits and practices, component selection, power regulation, data conversion, transmission line theory, signal integrity, layout guidelines, and PCB fabrication techniques each of which the students apply to a semester-spanning project. Student teams order custom PCB boards from commercial vendors, assemble circuits with SMT technology, program, test, and remediate their electronic projects.

This type of electric machines is well-known, however, their application in wind power plants appears to be a new engineering solution. Having a strong influence on generator design and its operational mode, special working conditions of wind power plants require a new approach to the engineering design, in particular to the design of generators to be applied in the above-mentioned field. The present article contains one of optimal engineering techniques that is based on mathematical modeling and is used to design double-fed generators for wind-power plants application. On the one hand, the mathematical model should be simple to be easily included into variety of programmed cycles in order to determine optimum dimensions. On the other hand, the mathematical model should be able to provide required accuracy of the main parameters and characteristics. Such mathematical model is described in the present article. Its basis is generalized variables with transparent physical significance, short variation range and fixed boundaries. The optimization algorithm uses Gauss-Seidel method coordinate descent approach to achieve optimum and Fibonacci method to select step.

However, this approach requires an advanced knowledge of digital design and computer architecture. Recently emerged high-level design tools make it easier for the programmers to code complex designs in C/Cþþ. High-level synthesis (HLS)1 and OpenCL2 are the two leading high-level design platforms that are becoming widely used for programming FPGAs. Their proponents claim that these tools require little to no knowledge of the hardware design principles and can significantly improve developer's productivity. In this article, we explore these two high-level design approaches from the point of view of a software developer. We use Xilinx Vivado HLS C/Cþþ ver. 2019.13 and Xilinx SDAccel OpenCL ver. 2019.14 to implement a cross-correlation operation from scratch and synthesize it for a Xilinx u250 Alveo FPGA board.5 The selected operation is at the core of convolutional neural networks and is generally nontrivial to implement using a traditional HDL methodology, but is rather simple to implement using a programming language, such as C. We opted not to focus on the design optimization, but rather getting a design that works on the FPGA with the minimal time spent on its implementation. We use the Xilinx SDAccel platform that provides support for implementing both OpenCL-and HLSbased kernels to run on an FPGA using OpenCL drivers on the host platform. We also took note of how capable each tool is in terms of optimization, without using tool-specific attributes or pragmas, as well as how well it utilizes the available hardware.

A unique point of our method is that we can redo the design and reconfigure it using the same tube after evacuating the air from the object. To provide detachable constraints on the tube for bending, we developed a novel technique with a hook-and-loop fastener attached on the tube. We also designed software to convert 3D targeted object shape to the bending pattern of the tube. Furthermore, we implemented a prototype of a machine for the automation of the attaching process of the fastener on the tube.

It requires both detailed and quantitative mathematical and experimental models of the processes to (re)design biology, and software and tools for genetic engineering and DNA assembly. Ultimately, the increased precision in the design phase will have a dramatic impact on the production of designer cells and organisms with bespoke functions and increased modularity. CAD strategies require quantitative models of cells that can capture multiscale processes and link genotypes to phenotypes. Here, we present a perspective on how whole-cell, multiscale models could transform design-build-test-learn cycles in synthetic biology. We show how these models could significantly aid in the design and learn phases while reducing experimental testing by presenting case studies spanning from genome minimization to cell-free systems.

There are 3D scanners capable of extracting data from distance more than a few meters away without contacting the objects but yet limited to same space range only. Although synchronizing the 3D scanners from another place can enable long distance data extraction, synchronizing devices over long distance can lead to other issues such as lagging. Moreover, the uses of 3D scanners usually involve quite long consumption time regardless of same space range or long distance range application. To overcome these issues, this study introduces a 3D surface reconstruction system by including a webcam imaging technique to produce a 3D point cloud, which is the same as that produced by a 3D scanner, and thus, eliminate the use of a 3D scanner. Through webcam imaging, image data can be transferred over the Internet and can be shared instantly even in different locations. Hence, webcam imaging is an alternative to using a 3D scanner. This system will continuously generate 3D free-form surfaces to resemble the surface profile of physical objects. Acquiring data until the surface fitting process will take less time compared with using a combination of 3D scanner and CAD software.

The atypical building design process is very different from existing building design processes because the generation and transformation of shapes occupies a large part of that process. In the process of designing atypical buildings, it is possible to overlook this safety and convenience while being immersed in form values. Ultimately, this study aims to develop a technology for architects to grasp the dwelling performance in a design in real time and to reflect it in the design. To do this, we developed a simulation module embedded in a commercial atypical design tool (Rhino and Grasshopper), named ActoViz. It transforms the designed plan into a 3D game-based virtual environment in real time and allows intelligent human figures to freely flow through the plan to evaluate it as including module. This study seeks to advance the development of ActoViz. There is a limit to the accuracy of user behavior simulations in which predetermined behavior models are simply repeated, because the physical forms of atypical buildings are so diverse. Since the realism of human-figured agents has a positive effect on the simulation, advanced and precise interactions between agent and space are very important. In this study, ragdoll physics and model predictive control techniques are applied to achieve more adaptive behavior for the virtual users. Through the use of such technologies, inconsistencies in the virtual users’ behaviors and the physical space can be minimized, and more natural reactions can be achieved. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.",Adaptive behavior; Architectural design; Atypical architectural space; Behavior simulation; Virtual user,Architectural design; Behavioral research; Computer aided software engineering; Human computer interaction; Model predictive control; Adaptive behavior; Architectural space; Autonomous adaptive behaviors; Behavior model; Building design process; Human behaviors; Simulation modules; User behaviors; Structural design,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85089238748

The purpose of this paper is to review the ways in which design methods and techniques used in other fields may be used in support of the space mission concept development process and space technology development. Designers are almost synonymous with the consumer product, automotive and entertainment industries. Fields such as Product Design, Transportation Design and Entertainment emphasize finding solutions to problems using exploratory design methods and techniques. Often, they are leaders in their organizations. However, there is not a direct appreciation or understanding of how to utilize these methods and techniques within aerospace. These methods have been shown to support mission concept development, however may also directly support technology development, as is seen in the consumer product industry. Evidence shows that these methods have sporadically been utilized by NASA for habitat design, software development and astronaut wearables. This paper explores opportunities within the space mission concept development process where these techniques are currently used and develops a design library of methods and techniques used outside of Aerospace that may be supportive of technology development. The current Pre-Phase A concept development process is mapped along with exploratory design methods used in other industries. Design Thinking is a heuristic problem solving method that can be applied to many fields. Human Centered Design and User Centered Design have been utilized for architecture and software development; these same tools could also be used to help inform the design of long term human habitation system on planetary surfaces. The Imagineering process is instrumental in theme park development; this paper argues it should also inform design of robotic science missions such as Mars Sciences. Science Fiction Thinking is a method of extrapolating future technology. How can this type of thinking inform the design of systems that aim to detect life in locations such as the liquid oceans on Europa and Titan? Techniques that are instrumental throughout these methods, such as storyboarding, sketching and prototyping are also defined. Interviews with employees within aerospace, consumer products and entertainment may shed light on opportunities and barriers to utilizing these techniques.

Nowadays, manual grinding and traditional robot on-line programming are difficult to ensure the surface grinding accuracy, thus off-line programming is gradually used in grinding, however, several problems are needed to be resolved which include: off-programming environment depends on the third-party CAD software, leads to insufficient self-development flexibility; single support for robot type or workpiece model format contributes to lack of versatility; grinding point data depends on external data calculation and import process, causes human-computer interaction deterioration. Design/methodology/approach: In this method, the visualization pipeline and observer/command mode of VTK are used to display the 3D model of the robot grinding system and pick up the workpiece surfaces to be grinded respectively. Two groups of cutter planes with equidistant spacing are created to form the grinding nodes on the surface, and the extraction method for the position and posture of the nodes is proposed. Furthermore, the position and posture of discretized points along the grinding curve are obtained by B-spline curve interpolation and quaternion spherical linear interpolation respectively. Finally, the motion simulation is realized by robot inverse kinematics. Findings: Through a watch case grinding experiment, the results show that the proposed method based on VTK can achieving high precision grinding effect, which is obviously better than traditional method. Originality/value: The proposed method is universal which does not depend on the specific forms of surface, and all calculations in simulation are completed within the system, avoiding tedious external data calculation and import process. The grinding trajectory can be generated only by the mouse picking operation without relying on the other third-party CAD software. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Freeform surface; Industrial robot grinding; Offline programming; Visualization toolkit (VTK),3D modeling; Agricultural robots; Computer aided design; Curve fitting; Deterioration; Grinding (machining); Human computer interaction; Human robot interaction; Interpolation; Inverse kinematics; Inverse problems; Machine design; Mammals; Three dimensional computer graphics; Visualization; Design/methodology/approach; Linear Interpolation; Off line programming; On-line programming; Programming environment; Robot inverse kinematics; Visualization pipeline; Visualization toolkits; Robot programming,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85084219264

Thus, since the development of 3D printing, the fused deposition modeling (FDM) is one of the most promising and inexpensive techniques for shaping free-form parts. It used a thermoplastic filament as a starting material to extrude, layer by layer, the suitable 3D object. It is assisted by a large community of developers, searchers, and users and with multiple free hardware and software open sources expanding the scope of its applications. However, in this process, printing objects with multi-materials and multicolors becomes a major challenge for most extrusion system of printing platforms. For example, in case it is required to print multi-material and multicolored parts, a high-quality head extruder should be used. The main objective of this work is to show the importance of proposing a new extruder system of printing parts with multicolors and materials. For this purpose, in the present paper, the different extrusion systems capable of printing parts with multicolors and materials were presented.

The weaving principle is mostly the same, requiring at least a set of weft yarns (picks) and a set of warp yarns(ends), but the way the ends are handled is what actually makes the difference. In Jacquard weaving, each warp yarn is controlled individually by a hook, rather than by a frame which also incorporates several other yarns, as in normal weaving. Therefore, a difference in the technology needed is also noticeable. We stand on the brink of the fourth industrial revolution, that will fundamentally alter the way we live, work and relate to one another. With that being said, digitalisation is something one must be aware of at all times. The emergence of electronic Jacquard mechanisms has made possible the large-scale use of CAD/CAM (Computer Aided Design and Computer Aided Manufacturing) systems for creating and producing fabrics with complex designs. The introduction of software to this process was a major turning point, reducing the amount of time needed to create the design and generate the card which controls the weaving machine. Nevertheless, precision has also increased, meaning that the software is able to correct human errors, going through each and every binding point and float. Furthermore, IoT (Internet of Things) encompasses a better communication between machines and a seamless wireless exchange of data between the computer where everything is created and the machines. The paper focuses on the methodology of designing and production of original patterns for double weft jacquard woven fabrics, using the Affinity Designer software for designing the repeat unit and the NedGraphics bundle (Texcell, LoomEditor, Weave Editor and Product Creator) for generating the card. A detailed description of the whole process will be provided to the reader, from the initial design file (.jpg or.png) to the generation of the final card (.ep file). It stimulates the curiosity and imagination of both textile engineering and fashion design students through eLearning, giving them a better look inside the whole process of turning their creations into actual products. It also challenges their capability of dealing with several issues and limitations of both software and hardware. The designed fabrics were realised on a Picanol loom equipped with a Bonas electronic Jacquard head, using 2400 hooks. © 2020, National Defence University-Carol I Printing House.

This research paper describes a student engagement evaluation model that combined data from three sources: in-class observations using the Behavioral Engagement Related to Instruction (BERI) protocol, one-to-one student interviews, and anonymous online surveys. We tested this model on a higher-level elective Computer Science class with 134 students, focusing on user experience (UX) design. We used the exact same usability engineering process that students employed in the course to design software products on assessing the course's effectiveness, with students acting as users and the class being the system under development. We present our exact methodology of data-driven analysis borrowed from UX design, which combines inductive reasoning (similar to narrative analysis or inductive coding) with deductive reasoning (similar to content analysis of qualitative data) used in social science research. Our paper includes a sample of the extracted requirements, similar to software non-functional requirements, which we used to redesign the course for the next semester. The results of this case study showed that the application of this mixed methods type of analysis informed by user-centered design of software systems was effective as a surrogate model of student-centered instructional design. Concluding, we extrapolate the lessons learned from this process and the significant implications we believe our industry-inspired methodology can have for engineering educators, in terms of evaluating student engagement in college classrooms. © American Society for Engineering Education 2020.",,Application programs; Curricula; Product design; Software design; Usability engineering; User centered design; User experience; Data-driven analysis; Engineering educators; Evaluation methodologies; Instructional designs; Non-functional requirements; Social science research; Usability engineering process; User experience design; Students,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85095796196

A small-scale cooking pot was designed and an experimental setup was installed to verify the model under various operating conditions. The developed model was solved using the Engineering Equation Solver software. Results were compared with those of the experiments and good agreement was obtained. Additionally, a computational fluid dynamics model was developed to verify the thermal model and have a useful design tool for large-scale cooking pots. It was found that the energy efficiency of the cooking process can be enhanced by initiating nucleate boiling (at ~5 °C minimum temperature difference between the heating element surface and saturation) which will supply the minimum heat flux on the helicoidal heat exchanger of the cooking pot. Lessening the energy demand but preserving the final product quality has decreased the 5-day biological oxygen demand of wastewater at least 50%. It is proposed that the wheat to water ratio can be reduced to 1.0−1.2 once the energy optimization and water recovery practices are satisfied. The estimated average specific energy consumption rate lies between 400-475 ±5% W/kg (thermal power supplied for one kilogram of wheat) which can be reduced ~25% further by reducing the wheat to water ratio to 1.0. The results reported in the present study are expected to guide thermal and food engineers for the design applications of industrial cooking pots, energy optimization with less harmful wastewater and process control strategies for cooking of wheat. © 2020 Turk IsÄ± Bilimi ve Teknigi Dernegi.

All definitions and functional features have been implemented within the JPAD software, a Java-based computing library for aircraft designers, which provides a dedicated geometric modeling module called JPADCAD. The geometric module, that comes as an application programming interface (API) built on top of the OpenCASCADE Technology solid modeling kernel, is conceived for the automatic production of parametric aircraft CAD geometries. The tool allows the definition of input geometries for low-fidelity as well as high-fidelity aerodynamic analyses, hence proves to be a key factor in the entire MDAO process, particularly in conceptual or preliminary design analysis workflows. The main goal of such a geometric library remains ease of use and support for automation to minimize unnecessary or repetitive human effort. The backbone of the presented methodology is the parametric definition of a generic commercial transport aircraft configuration that translates into software data structures and functionalities of CAD surface modelers.

These tiny devices transform and shape our lives and will continue to do so in ways we have yet to discover. Skills and knowledge in semiconductor devices are therefore essential for the development of a more sustainable world. Nevertheless, the ways we teach semiconductor devices are still rooted in 20th century textbooks and methods. Learning methods and materials therefore need to be updated so that students learn in ways that are appropriate for the global, dynamic and transnational environments in which they will work. Our methodology relied on using modern Technology CAD (TCAD) device simulations to revolutionize the teaching of semiconductor devices. Based on student responses, we believe that our methodology will enhance student employability and encourage student understanding of advanced semiconductor concepts, which are required for managing the global sustainability challenges. We demonstrate how the application of state-of-the art simulation and visualization CAD tools can be used to teach undergraduate students how to understand the basic principles of key electronic devices.

Based on an educational mobile inverted pendulum robot, students are introduced to product design and prototyping by identifying an existing problem with a component in the robot, redesigning the component using computer aided design software, and then building a prototype using additive manufacturing methods. Subsequently, a set of hypothetical design requirement changes is imposed, and various design methods and manufacturing processes that can be used to make components to satisfy these new requirements are discussed. Topics covered include integrated product design, additive manufacturing prototyping based on different technologies, plastic injection molding, sand casting, and fundamentals of both computer aided manufacturing and computer numerical control machining. Tools, fixtures, and accessories required in these processes, as well as associated challenges, are also discussed. This course adapts the inquiry-based learning active learning pedagogical approach and focuses on the development of students’ ability to conduct analytical analysis and to apply a knowledge of mathematics, science, engineering, and technology to solve practical engineering technology problems. As an introductory course designed to be offered to freshman level students, this course engages students in engineering technology related topics and stimulates their interest in manufacturing related subjects. It helps with improving the engineering student retention rate and serves as a pathway connecting students to more advanced specialized manufacturing courses such as computer numerical control machining technology.

Over the years, avant-garde architects have explored the feasibility of this new design paradigm through the integration of newly-developed digital design software into automated construction. This robotic digital workflow continues to push designers to re-think the complete architecture process (from design conception to physical construction) and guides the building industry towards more precise, efficient, and sustainable development. However, in the current environment of architectural education, professional courses can be fragmented, thematic, and overly academic. Such content is not inherently compatible with the latest technological developments. The lack of understanding and application of digital technological can subsequently lead to the lack of sustainable development in architectural education.

This paper challenges this split, and proposes eight principles for developing computational design tools that facilitate productive interactions across hand crafts and computational media. I derive these principles from my ethnographic and design studies of the wire-bending craft, which has been practiced in the Trinidad and Tobago Carnival since the 1930s, as well as from my development of an experimental digital design tool to build 3-D lines in space, informed by these studies. The tool, which enables users to generate linear designs and fabricate them using linear materials such as wire, is presented as an instrument to codify, reflect upon, and extend the Trinidadian wire-bending tradition. This paper acknowledges the Trinidad Carnival as a contested design space, political arena, and creative outlet through which individuals and communities express their imagination, innovation, and craftsmanship.

The developed robotic systems are divided into different modules, these modules are attached on the Design Education Platform. This paper shows the in-house development of this platform with regard to the requirements from the design education course and technical specifications. In this context, findings from an earlier developed product family architecture of a robotic system as reference are integrated. The product architecture is shown in a module interface graph, displaying the component variety as well as their linkages. A description of the used mechanical and electrical components and their computational as well as communication possibilities is shown. The problem-based learning course and its interdisciplinary teaching concept are presented. First findings are formulated and the resulting products of student teams of summer semester 2019 are shown. These first product variants are the starting point of a product family, with new modules and resulting product variants each semester.

Before a physical prototype of a vehicle or vehicle powertrain is tested, engineers build and test virtual prototypes of the design(s) on multiple stages throughout the development cycle. In addition, controllers and physical prototypes of subsystems are tested under simulated signals before a physical prototype of the vehicle is available. Different departments within an automotive company tend to use different modelling and simulation tools specific to the needs of their specific engineering discipline. While this makes sense considering the development of the said system, subsystem, or component, modern holistic vehicle engineering requires the constituent parts to operate in synergy with one-another in order to ensure vehicle-level optimal performance. Due to the above, integrated simulation of the models developed in different environments is necessary. While a large volume of existing co-simulation related publications aimed towards engineering software developers, user-oriented publications on the characteristics of integration methods are very limited. This paper reviews the current trends in model integration methods applied within the automotive industry. The reviewed model integration methods are evaluated and compared with respect to an array of criteria such as required workflow, software requirements, numerical results, and simulation speed by means of setting up and carrying out simulations on a set of different model integration case studies. The results of this evaluation constitute a comparative analysis of the suitability of each integration method for different automotive design applications. This comparison is aimed towards the end-users of simulation tools, who in the process of setting up a holistic high-level vehicle model, may have to select the most suitable among an array of available model integration techniques, given the application and the set of selection criteria. © 2020 SAE International.

Effective integration of production resources with intralogistics systems for transport and handling equipment requires, among others determining the layout of transport paths, the type of transport means, their capacity, number of actuators or number of containers, etc. In the process of solving individual partial problems and design, various methods and techniques supporting decision making are used, including mathematical methods, heuristics, or artificial intelligence methods. Due to the complexity, they are often approximate or suboptimal methods. Therefore, there is a need to verify the solutions obtained, especially in connection with other subsystems in the conditions of various data and parameters related to production orders.

Modeling and simulation is the essential bridge from good science to good engineering, spanning from fundamental understanding of materials behavior to deliberate design of new materials technologies leveraging new properties and processes. This Roadmap presents a broad overview of the extensive impact computational modeling has had in materials science in the past few decades, and offers focused perspectives on where the path forward lies as this rapidly expanding field evolves to meet the challenges of the next few decades. The Roadmap offers perspectives on advances within disciplines as diverse as phase field methods to model mesoscale behavior and molecular dynamics methods to deduce the fundamental atomic-scale dynamical processes governing materials response, to the challenges involved in the interdisciplinary research that tackles complex materials problems where the governing phenomena span different scales of materials behavior requiring multiscale approaches. The shift from understanding fundamental materials behavior to development of quantitative approaches to explain and predict experimental observations requires advances in the methods and practice in simulations for reproducibility and reliability, and interacting with a computational ecosystem that integrates new theory development, innovative applications, and an increasingly integrated software and computational infrastructure that takes advantage of the increasingly powerful computational methods and computing hardware. © 2020 The Author(s).

The crucial moment of production is to measure the spool being built, compare it with the design and define the geometry corrections that should be applied at the construction stage. At present, the comparison of spools is usually done in a manual manner in a CAD program or other software dedicated for this purpose and is implemented by combining variously defined translations and rotations. This approach is time-consuming and the results strongly depend on the survey engineer's experience. In this article, a method of comparing the shape of two spools, based on isometric transformation and robust estimation, has been proposed. This method can be used to automate the comparison process. In standard approach, applied by both design engineers and assemblers, spools are described by a set of coordinates and, in the case of flanges, by sets of appropriately defined angular values. A method of flange description suitable for use in the isometric transformation process has been proposed, and potential problems that may appear at the implementation stage of the algorithm have been discussed. The proposed method makes it possible to determine the elements of a spool that do not fit into the design project in a way that allows minimizing the number of corrections at the construction stage.  © 2020 Swiȩtoń Tomasz et al., published by De Gruyter 2020.",dimensional control; flange; isometric transformation; pipe spool; robust estimation,Computer aided design; Flanges; Gas industry; Petroleum industry; Piping systems; Construction stages; Design engineers; Isometric transformation; Minimizing the number of; Oil and Gas Industry; Potential problems; Precise determinations; Robust estimation; algorithm; comparative study; computer aided design; construction method; design; error correction; estimation method; gas industry; geometry; oil industry; pipe; steel structure; Reels,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85093644974

HVAC system is responsible for the demisting and defrosting of the vehicle's windshield and for creating/maintaining a pleasing environment inside the cabin by controlling airflow, velocity, temperature and purity of air. Fog or ice which forms on the windshield is the main reason for invisibility and leads to major safety issues to the customers while driving. It has been shown that proper clear visibility for the windshield could be obtained with a better flow pattern and uniform flow distribution in the defrost mode of the HVAC system and defrost duct. Defroster performance has received significant attention from OEMs to meet the specific global performance standards of FMVSS103 and SAE J902. Therefore, defroster performance is seriously taken into consideration during the design of HVAC system and defroster duct. The HVAC unit provides hot air to the defroster duct which is blowing high velocity air to the windscreen to clear the frosting. Currently as a traditional defrost duct design process, multiple flow simulation needs to be carried out for various design configurations of defrost duct through CFD analysis until the performance targets are achieved during the design cycle and it is very time consuming. In this paper, the focus is to develop defrost duct modelling using parameterization technique and optimize the defrost duct system to meet the performance requirements through robust optimization Design for Six Sigma (DFSS) methodology to reduce the design time, cost, size and weight of the system. Parametric modelling technique is used for designing the defrost duct through design software to reduce the design time for simulation. A 3-dimensional model (3D) of a car cabin with full a HVAC system was developed using Star-CCM+® to predict the performance of the system in the windshield. DFSS methodology helps in finding out the optimized design factors of defrost duct to meet the performance targets such as pressure drop, airflow and velocity at windshield aim points simultaneously. The optimized defrost duct design results were compared with the baseline defrost duct design results and the improvement in performance results is achieved by more than 60%. © 2020 FCA US LLC.",,3D modeling; Air; Climate control; Computational fluid dynamics; Computer software; Flow patterns; HVAC; Optimization; Process engineering; Six sigma; Windshields; 3-dimensional modeling; Design configurations; Design of hvac systems; Parameterization techniques; Parametric modelling; Performance requirements; Robust optimization design; Uniform flow distributions; Air conditioning ducts,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85083865318

Blended learning provides an ideal platform for the implementation of reusable learning objects (RLOs) as a pedagogical tool to support classroom instruction. Design/methodology/approach: This study had conducted a quasi-experiment followed by semi-structured interviews to determine if a blended learning approach using RLOs can enhance students’ learning in an undergraduate engineering computer-aided design (CAD) module. This study involved learners studying engineering in two different academic years. Findings: Students from the first year were taught using traditional face-to-face teaching approach. The cohort of students from the subsequent year adopted a blended learning approach: face to face and access to a series of RLOs. The analysis revealed statistical evidence that the use of blended learning had a significant impact on the students' end of term exam grades in the CAD module in comparison to the students who undertook traditional face-to-face teaching approach. The qualitative findings highlighted the positive impact of RLOs on students’ learning behaviour, engagement and knowledge retention. Originality/value: This study provided empirical evidence of the benefits of using RLOs as a blended learning tool in engineering domain. From a theoretical perspective, the findings highlighted the importance of good instructional design and sound theoretical underpinning of the pedagogical strategy. From a practical point of view, this study informed academics on how to improve learner's academic achievement using RLOs. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Design; Design software; Engineering; Reusable learning objects,,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85087759767

In this article, a three-layered system architecture is presented to generate sensor-based robot skills from an assembly task instance. The architecture consists of an application layer where the user instantiates assembly tasks by specifying CAD constraints between geometric primitives pairs. A process layer infers the most suitable robot skills and their appropriate parameters. This inference is made possible by reasoning on a knowledge database represented as an ontology. The ontology contains semantic models of relevant classes such as tasks, skills, and geometric primitives as well as the relations between them. A control layer executes the sensor-based skills in real time using the eTaSL programming framework. A software implementation for the three layers is presented. The application layer is implemented in FreeCAD, whereas the process layer consists of a Web ontology language (OWL) ontology, a Prolog-based reasoner, and fuzzy inference to correctly select the skill and generate its parameters. In the control layer, the instantiated eTaSL skills execute the assembly tasks by sending an optimized control command to the robot. The system is validated on two challenging assembly cases with two distinct robot types, thus demonstrating the system's capability across different scenarios. Note to Practitioners-The widespread use of computer-aided design (CAD) models for describing parts assembly has motivated the research community to create systems that automatically generate robot programs satisfying the assembly goal. While most of the existing literature focuses on generating the assembly sequence, this article deals with the aspect of translation from CAD-level assembly specification to executable robot motion, also called skills. This article systematically addresses the problem by dividing it into different layers and solving them separately. Parameters that influence the successful execution of an assembly task are identified and categorized into application-and process-related parameters. Different inference techniques are employed to address each parameter category. Experimental results show that the proposed system can successfully generate and execute robot skills for assembly scenarios of an air compressor and an electric motor.  © 2004-2012 IEEE.",Assembly systems; computer-aided software engineering; force control; knowledge-based systems; robot programming,Application Layer; Computer aided design; Computer architecture; Fuzzy inference; Machine design; Ontology; PROLOG (programming language); Robotics; Robots; Semantics; Geometric primitives; Knowledge database; Layered system architecture; Programming framework; Sensor based robot; Software implementation; System architectures; Web ontology language; Robotic assembly,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85083436769

These fibres can mimic the morphology of a natural extracellular matrix, enabling tissue analogues for transplantation or personalised drug screening. To date, MEW has employed two different collector-plate modalities for the fabrication of constructs. Flat collector plates, typical of traditional 3D printing methods, allow for the layer-by-layer fabrication of 2D structures into complex 3D structures. Alternatively, rotating mandrels can be used for the creation of tubular scaffolds. However, unlike other additive manufacturing techniques that can immediately start and stop the extrusion of material during printing, MEW instead requires a continuous flow of polymer. Consequently, conventional g-code control software packages are unsuitable. To overcome this challenge, a suite of customised pattern generation software tools have been developed to enable the design of MEW scaffolds with highly-controlled geometry, including crosshatch, gradient porosity, tubular, and patient-specific configurations. The high level of design control using this approach enables the production of scaffolds with highly adaptable mechanical properties, as well as the potential to influence biological properties for cell attachment and proliferation. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",,"Extracellular Matrix; Humans; Porosity; Printing, Three-Dimensional; Tissue Engineering; Tissue Scaffolds; 3D printers; Biomechanics; Complex networks; Controlled drug delivery; Plates (structural components); biomaterial; Biological properties; Control software package; Extracellular matrices; Layer-by-layer fabrication; Manufacturing techniques; Patient specific; Pattern Generation; Tubular scaffold; adult; Article; biomechanics; bone tissue; cell adhesion; cell proliferation; ear cartilage; electrospinning; equipment design; geometry; human; human tissue; male; MC3T3-E1 cell line; micro-computed tomography; middle aged; pore size; porosity; priority journal; scanning electron microscopy; software; tensile strength; three dimensional printing; tissue engineering; extracellular matrix; tissue engineering; tissue scaffold; Scaffolds (biology)",Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85079695020

It is subjected to continuous cyclic wave loads during services, causing fatigue damage to the platform structures. In design of this kind of structures, assessments of fatigue damage become particularly important. Spectral fatigue analysis approach is a computationally efficient method to describe the random nature of environmental ocean wave conditions during calculating wave loads on the offshore jacket structures and subsequently structural responses. However, its fundamental theory is based on the assumption of linearity of both structural system and wave loading mechanism，but it has still been widely utilized for the design and assessment of shallow water jacket platforms with strong nonlinear mechanism. Therefore, the paper focuses on the studies on the improvement of the accuracies of the fatigue calculations by a new technical approach that can reduce the errors in the spectral fatigue analysis of shallow water platforms. This new approach can reasonably reflect the individually local sea state data by using wave height-period joint probability density function, the discussions of comparisons between the improved approach and the design code oriented method carry out by means of the analysis results. In addition, the wave probability density function which is employed for computing the fatigue damage in the existing design software is only effective for the narrow band spectra, and it causes additional errors for the broadband spectra during the computation of the fatigue damage.

Immersive environments (IEs) can create a dynamic, multi-sensory, first-person view in computer-generated environments, and can improve designers' visual perception and awareness during performative design processes. This research addresses the need for interactive and integrated design tools for IEs toward better-performing architectural solutions in terms of daylighting illumination. In this context, building information modeling and performance simulations are identified as critical technologies to be integrated into performative architectural design. Design/methodology/approach: This research adopts a design science research (DSR) methodology involving an iterative process of development, validation and improvement of a novel and immersive tool, HoloArch, that supports design development during daylighting-informed design processes. HoloArch was implemented in a game engine during a spiral software development process. HoloArch allows users to interact with, visualize, modify and explore architectural models. The evaluation is performed in two workshops and a user study. A hybrid approach that combines qualitative and quantitative data collection was adopted for evaluation. Qualitative data analyses involve interviews, while quantitative data analyses involve both daylighting simulations and questionnaires (e.g. technology acceptance model (TAM), presence and system usability scale (SUS)). Findings: According to the questionnaire results, HoloArch had 92/100 for SUS, a mean value of 120.4 for presence questionnaire (PQ) and 9.4/10 for TAM. According to the simulation results, all participants improved the given building's daylighting performance using HoloArch. The interviews also indicated that HoloArch is an effective design tool in terms of augmented perception, continuous design processes, performative daylighting design and model interaction. However, challenges still remain regarding the complete integration of tools and simultaneous simulation visualization. The study concludes that IEs hold promising potentials where performative design actions at conceptual, spatial and architectural domains can take place interactively and simultaneously with immediate feedback. Originality/value: The research integrates building information modeling (BIM), performative daylighting simulations and IEs in an interactive environment for the identification of potentials and limitations in performative architectural design. Different from existing immersive tools for architecture, HoloArch offers a continuous bidirectional workflow between BIM tools and IEs. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Architecture; Building information modeling; Design; Innovation; Integration; Simulation,Daylighting; Information theory; Iterative methods; Sensory perception; Software design; Surveys; Building Information Model - BIM; Design science researches (DSR); Design/methodology/approach; Interactive Environments; Qualitative data analysis; Software development process; System Usability Scale (SUS); Technology acceptance model; Architectural design,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85096713073

Aside from culminating design projects usually completed during their senior year, many undergraduate programs have been incorporating design experiences throughout the curriculum, even starting as early as the freshman year. The emphasis of many institutions on entrepreneurial activities as well as the prevalence of multidisciplinary projects through student clubs have also increased the need for students to rapidly prototype their designs. As many of these activities require the design of electronic printed circuit boards, it has become increasingly important for students to learn about the tools needed to efficiently design printed circuit boards (PCBs). In many ECE curricula, PCB design is expected either to be self-taught as part of the senior design process, is offered as a workshop, or is appended to another course such as circuit design. By specifically teaching PCB design principles through a formal lab course, students are better equipped to implement increasingly complex projects during their curricular experiences. Having learned the basic design principles and tools necessary for PCB design, students also become better positioned to participate in various design competitions through student clubs and other organizations. The lab course developed and described in this paper provides students with an opportunity to gain skills in the fundamental PCB design principles, which they can then use to build more advanced board circuitry as they progress through their curriculum. The course is offered as a full semester distance education offering and hence provides students with the flexibility to complete their weekly lab assignments without the need to physically come to campus each week. The paper provides a comparison of PCB design software and the justifications for adoption of the chosen software tool for the course. Weekly lab experiments and their learning objectives are described, together with their achieved outcomes. The approach used for providing students with soldering training as well as the benefits and challenges of teaching the course online are also included. Experiences gained from offering the course during a full 15-week semester are discussed, and recommendations for potential future offerings are presented. © American Society for Engineering Education 2020.",,Curricula; E-learning; Integrated circuit manufacture; Laboratories; Printed circuit design; Students; Teaching; Timing circuits; Design competitions; Electrical and computer engineering; Entrepreneurial activity; Learning objectives; Multidisciplinary projects; Printed circuit board (PCBs); Printed circuit board designs; Undergraduate program; Printed circuit boards,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85095735810

The surgical discipline is one of the major players in the medical field using the constantly developing 3D planning and printing capabilities. Computer-assisted design (CAD) and computer assisted manufacturing (CAM) are used to describe the 3D planning and manufacturing of the product. The planning and manufacturing of 3D surgical guides and reconstruction implants is performed almost exclusively by engineers. As technology advances and software interfaces become more user-friendly, it raises a question regarding the possibility of transferring the planning and manufacturing to the clinician. The reasons for such a shift are clear: the surgeon has the idea of what he wants to design, and he also knows what is feasible and could be used in the operating room. It allows him to be prepared for any scenario/unexpected results during the operation and allows the surgeon to be creative and express his new ideas using the CAD software. The purpose of this method is to provide clinicians with the ability to create their own surgical guides and reconstruction implants. In this manuscript, a detailed protocol will provide a simple method for segmentation using segmentation software and implant planning using a 3D design software. Following the segmentation and stl file production using segmentation software, the clinician could create a simple patient specific reconstruction plate or a more complex plate with a cradle for bone graft positioning. Surgical guides can be created for accurate resection, hole preparation for proper reconstruction plate positioning or for bone graft harvesting and re-contouring.

This work explores form-finding methods of the Voronoi shell as a compressive funicular shell. Two closed-form solutions to shape initialization are proposed. We develop methods for minimizing the deviation from coplanarity between timber members and adjacent surface normal in order to facilitate manufacturing. A well-defined fabrication process is important for making the physical structure consistent with the structural model. A 6-axis robot with a motor spindle is employed to prefabricate the timber so the in situ manual assembly becomes easier. A parametric model describes the joint details. We formulate the robotic toolpath as a closed-form function of the resultant mesh from form finding.

These tools are of great utility in both analysis and design. Firstly, they offer the ability to combine advanced dynamic positioning and gangway simulation to evaluate operational safety limits across a large spectrum of weather conditions. Secondly, they can be used as a design tool, in which many variants of design parameters can be altered and simulated, evaluating the design choices with highest efficacy. This paper presents SINTEF Ocean's vessel simulator, VeSim, and its results in a numerical DP3 study of a windfarm support vessel operating in DP mode near a platform. These results are presented with a thorough validation against modelscale test results, also performed by SINTEF Ocean in its Ocean Basin Laboratory. In these tests, VeSim used SINTEF Ocean's inhouse DP algorithm to control the model-scale vessel in a realtime hybrid testing environment, which is extensible to arbitrary controller designs. Through this validation task, the simulator's value is demonstrated as an effective tool for dynamic positioning simulation in its own right. Additionally, the approach taken is shown to emphasise VeSim's use in both a hardware-in-theloop and software-in-the-loop testing environment. The simulation framework is described, including its modelling of environments, propulsion and hydrodynamics, and its implementation of SINTEF Ocean's in-house DP algorithm. The model test are described in detail, with especial focus on the use of VeSim and how its DP-controller was used as a controller in a hybrid testing environment.

However, technological development has provided researchers with an opportunity of having other procedures in line with modern techniques in surveying sciences. One of the most important procedures in erecting steel structures, bridges, and precast columns of a building is the accurate placement of the anchorage system in concrete. The traditional method for staking out anchor bolts relies on sight rails, string lines, and tape measure. The precision of this art depends not only on the accuracy of observed offset distances during layout operations but also on the centerline of the anchoring template itself. Nowadays, the process of designing structures is executed using software that can perform a digital plan in CAD environment, where the coordinates of each anchor bolt can be defined. This research presents an accurate approach of positioning anchor bolts based on the second problem in surveying and total station. Error analysis and field application are described to evaluate the performance of the proposed method. However, the results indicate that the developed technique increases productivity, reduces the cost, and improves the positional accuracy. © 2020. M. HABIB, A. MALKAWI, M.

Artificial intelligence (AI) has significant potential to advance the profession in making sense of massive amounts of aerial data and answer to its request for automation. In a recent industry study, over 50% of the respondents mentioned that ""lack of automation""is their number one pain point and desire that technology can address in the future. This paper describes the capabilities and limitations of AI applied to surveying, informed by the development of the AirWorks software, and the first tool that creates CAD drawings autonomously by extracting features of aerial images. It demonstrates significant time savings, and how these can be overcome collaboratively going forward.  © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.",,Antennas; Computer aided design; Data handling; Surveys; Aerial images; CAD drawings; Extracting features; Industry needs; New approaches; Artificial intelligence,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85093102391

Design for AM (DfAM) is recognised as a multi-faceted problem, exasperated by constraints to creativity, knowledge propagation, insufficiencies in education and a fragmented software pipeline. This study proposes a novel approach to increase the creativity in DfAM. Through comparison between DfAM and in utero human development, the unutilised potential of design through the time domain was identified. Therefore, the aim of the research is to develop a computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) programme to demonstrate design through the time domain, known as Temporal DfAM (TDfAM). This was achieved through a bespoke MATLAB code which applies a linear function to a process parameter, discretised across the additive build. TDfAM was demonstrated through the variation of extrusion speed combined with the infill angle, through the axial and in-plane directions. It is widely accepted in the literature that AM processing parameters change the properties of AM materials. Thus, the application of the TDfAM approach offers the engineer increased creative scope and control, whilst inherently upskilling knowledge, in the design of AM materials. © 2020, The Author(s).",Additive manufacturing; CAD; CAM; Computer-aided manufacturing; Design; Developmental biology; Innovation,3D printers; Additives; Biology; Cams; Computer aided manufacturing; Design; Design for manufacturability; Industrial research; MATLAB; Developmental biology; Economic revenue; Human development; In-plane direction; Knowledge propagation; Process parameters; Processing parameters; Software pipeline; Computer aided design,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85077529030

In a world where business is more competitive, organizations aim to increase their productivity at a lower cost, without affecting the quality of their products, or the health of their workers, so that the economic profit margin can be increased and be able to face the competition. Not only can new technologies improve quality and productivity, this can also be achieved by learning to use the machines at hand effectively. For this reason, in the company under study, the department of electrical connectors is intended to improve productivity with connector assembly machines that are in four parts. In addition to the fact that there is a problem of absenteeism and rotation of the staff with those of entry-level recruits, for this reason the management of this department is analyzing the way to invest capital for the improvement of the connector assembly machines and increase the capacity, in such way to eliminate the night shift. Therefore, the company’s main objective is to increase production capacity and thereby improve the efficiency indicators of connector assembly machines in the department of electrical connectors by 25%. For this purpose, the 3 main approaches of the organization are covered, which are: safety, quality and service (for financial projects), using tools found in the plant, such as CNC, lathe and milling machines, statistical software, ergonomics, CAD and engineering work, to identify relevant information that improves the efficiency in the process of said machinery. This project is an explanatory study, since it provides a profound response on the modification of the connector assembly machine. The method used is inductive since a working hypothesis was formulated and tested. Regarding data collection techniques, different methods were implemented, among which are: time-taking, route method, application of the 5s methodology and design of experiments. According to the results, an increase in the capacity of connector assembly machines was achieved by up to 59%, that is, 500 more pieces per hour. © 2020, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Continuous improvement; Efficiency; Productivity; Standardization,Assembly machines; Competition; Computer aided design; Decision making; Design of experiments; Efficiency; Electric connectors; Human resource management; Productivity; Baja california; Data collection; Efficiency indicators; Electrical connectors; Engineering works; Increase productions; Network solutions; Statistical software; Ergonomics,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85088583203

This rapid prototyping methodology is transforming how medical devices are designed, developed, and manufactured by enabling low-volume and on-demand production without dedicated equipment or tooling. In brief, computer-aided design software is used to generate a 3D model that is then exported into a file format that describes the volume or surface mesh in 3D space. Another program, generally known as a “slicer,” is then used to translate the 3D data into individual layers to be printed using a multiaxis positioning system through a variety of processes, including extrusion deposition, solidification, polymerization, sintering, or binding. A subset of additive manufacturing includes living cells during the printing process and has been termed bioprinting. Specifically, bioprinting enables robotic deposition of cells and materials into custom shapes and patterns to replicate anatomical complexity associated with tissues and organs. Bioprinting has been adopted for tissue engineering with the goal of developing highly customized cell-laden scaffolds to enable healthy human tissue to be regrown from a patient’s own stem cells. This chapter provides an overview of common 3D printing modalities and design considerations for bioprinting. Current applications of 3D printing technologies in different facets of the medical field are highlighted to demonstrate the current and future impact of additive manufacturing in healthcare. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

Several aspects are addressed, covering CAD (Computer-Aided Design) modelling systems to CAE (Computer-Aided Engineering) solutions, in terms of analysis and validation of mechanical resistance calculations. Therefore, structural mechanics fundamental concepts and mechanics of materials are also addressed. Particular focus is given on the development of curricula components related to Computer-Aided Design and Manufacturing. Doing so, three-dimensional structural modelling is applied to study the behaviour in selected simple case-studies where an external load is applied and the corresponding deflections are evaluated. Then, analytical and numerical analyses are performed and compared. During classes, patent aversion to solve analytical problems was clearly observed on the part of the students once calculus knowledge was required. The typical trend in engineering students, skipping the manual analytical methodology to solve a problem in order to go straight to numerical simulations via commercial Finite Element (FE) codes, was observed. The main focus of this work is, therefore, to determine the pedagogical effects of allying the analytical procedures and virtual simulators. It was possible to confirm the beneficial aspects of such methodology, considering that the regular engineering student has already a scientific basis on calculus and analytical process. Such knowledge will support mechanical project decisions, from model development to the analysis, and a sounding background to perform criticism of the results provided by the software. © 2020 by the authors.

To find the optimal operating conditions, a designer must evaluate the ORC from different perspectives including thermodynamic performance, technological limits, economic viability, and environmental impact. A popular approach to include different criteria simultaneously is to formulate a bi-objective optimization problem. This type of multi-objective optimization (MOO) allows for finding a set of optimal design points by defining two different objectives. Once the optimization is completed, the decision-making analysis shall be carried out to identify the final design solution. This study aims to develop a decision-making tool for facilitating the choice of the optimal design point. The proposed procedure is coded in MATLAB based on the commonly used Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS). By providing the capability to graphically identify the decisions taken, the tool developed in the study is called Tracking and Recognizing Alternative Design Solutions (TRADeS). Analysis of our data shows that certain regions of Pareto set points should be excluded from the design space. It was noted that in these regions a high rate at which one of the objectives moves away from its ideal value coincides with a low rate at which the second criterion approaches its ideal solution. Hence, it was recommended that the criteria weights corresponding to excluded regions of the Pareto set should be discarded when selecting the final design point. By comparing the results obtained using the proposed model to those of existing decision-making techniques, it was concluded that while the known approaches are appropriate for an easy and fast selection of the final design point, the presented procedure allows for a more comprehensive and well-rounded design. It was shown that our design tool can be successfully applied in the decision-making analysis for problems that aim at optimizing the ORC using two design criteria. Finally, the proposed software benefits from a generic structure and is easy to implement which will facilitate its use in other industrial applications. © 2020 by the authors.

However, a recurring implementation challenge has been the need to locally calibrate the software to reflect an agency’s design and construction practices, materials, and climate. This study introduced a framework to automate the calibration processes of the PMED performance models. This automated technique can search PMED output files and identify relevant damages/distresses for a project on a particular date. After obtaining this damage/distress information, the technique conducts model verification with the global calibration factors. Transfer function coefficients are then automatically derived following an optimization technique and numerical measures of goodness-of-fit. An equivalence statistical testing approach is conducted to ensure predicted performance results are in agreement with the measured data. The automated technique allows users to select one of three sampling approaches: Split sampling, jackknifing, or bootstrapping. Based on the sampling approach chosen, the automated technique provides the calibration coefficients or suitable ranges for the coefficients and shows the results graphically.

The design of these architectures allows architects to master building complex software systems. But, their informal description, may give rise to ambiguity, their understanding becomes more and more difficult and leads to the incorrect implementation of these software systems. There are many solutions allowing software architecture design. In this paper, we use software design patterns as a solution. This is due to their reusable software elements. Our principal objective is to propose other alternatives to the informal visual description of software architectures. In past work, we have studied Service Oriented Architectures. We used SOA design patterns with standard formal notations. This work is a continuation to the past one. We apply our approach on design patterns for the Internet of Things. We introduce a refinement-based approach for modeling IoT design patterns. It takes advantage of graphical modeling and formal method. It is organized around two main axes. The first axis is to provide modeling solutions in conformance with the UML standard language. The second axis covers the general specification of design pattern models with the Event-B method.

The challenge included various tasks, such as bin picking, kitting, and assembly of standard industrial parts into 2D and 3D assemblies. Some of the tasks were only revealed at the competition itself, representing the challenge of ‘level 5’ automation, i.e. programming and setting up an autonomous assembly system in less than one day. We conducted a survey among the teams that participated in the challenge and investigated aspects such as team composition, development costs, system setups as well as the teams' strategies and approaches. An analysis of the survey results reveals that the competitors have been in two camps: those constructing conventional robotic work cells with off-the-shelf tools, and teams who mostly relied on custom-made end effectors and novel software approaches in combination with collaborative robots. While both camps performed reasonably well, the winning team chose a middle ground in between, combining the efficiency of established play-back programming with the autonomy gained by CAD-based object detection and force control for assembly operations. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group and The Robotics Society of Japan.",assembly; factory automation; multi-stage planning; robot competitions; Robots in manufacturing,Assembly; Assembly machines; Computer aided design; End effectors; Factory automation; Manufacture; Object detection; Object recognition; Surveys; Assembly operations; Autonomous assembly; Collaborative robots; Industrial assemblies; Multi-stage planning; Robot competitions; Robotic work cells; Software approach; Robot programming,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85077382366

They not only can be applied to pure substances as well as to mixtures but also constitute the heart of commercially available computer-aided-process-design software. In the last 20 years, thousands of publications have been devoted to the development of sophisticated models or to the improvement of already existing EoSs. Chemical engineering thermodynamics is thus a field under steady development, and to assess the accuracy of a thermodynamic model or to cross-compare two models, it is necessary to confront model predictions with experimental data. In this context, the importance of a reliable free-to-access benchmark database is pivotal and becomes absolutely necessary. The goal of this paper is thus to present a database, specifically designed to assess the accuracy of a thermodynamic model or cross-compare models, to explain how it was developed and to enlighten how to use it. A total of 200 nonelectrolytic binary systems have been selected and divided into nine groups according to the associating character of the components, i.e., their ability to be involved in a hydrogen bond (the nature and strength of the association phenomena are indeed considered a measure of the complexity to model the thermodynamic properties of mixtures). The methodology for assessing the performance of a given model is then described. As an illustration, the Peng-Robinson EoS with classical van der Waals mixing rules and a temperature-dependent binary interaction parameter (kij) have been used to correlate the numerous data included in the proposed database, and its performance has been assessed following the proposed methodology.  © 2020 American Chemical Society.",,Benchmarking; Database systems; Equations of state; Hydrogen bonds; Systems (metallurgical); Thermodynamic properties; Van der Waals forces; Benchmark database; Binary interaction parameter; Computer-aided process designs; Correlation and prediction; Engineering thermodynamics; Temperature dependent; Thermodynamic model; Van der waals mixing rule; Binary mixtures,Article,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85096470851

Supported start-up saves fuel or electrical energy, increases operator safety and level of autonomy, extends the application area, and, in some applications, even enables the operator to shape the motion characteristics of the initial phase of a UAV's flight. Currently used solutions, depending on an aircraft's class, are based on the utilization of rubber, pneumatic or electromagnetic launchers. All of these launchers are used for the medium class of UAVs and all of them use the potential energy previously stored in stretched rubber, compressed air or electrical voltage. In this paper, authors propose the novel concept of a launcher powered through kinetic energy stored in a rotary wheel driven by an electric motor. Using the transmission systems of the drive and the controlled clutch and an electromagnetic brake, it is possible to precisely control the speed and acceleration of the launched object. Within the paper, the authors present and discuss the applied equations of dynamics, the results of a simulation that was carried out using the MATLAB/Simulink software and a conceptual CAD model of preliminary engineering solutions for the kinetic UAV launcher.

In general, traditional design techniques, designing based on anthropometric data, and derived mathematical models do not incorporate enough subject data to design a customized product. First, anthropometric measurements on the right hand of 60 participants were collected with a contour gauge to manufacture matching handles. A curved handle fitting the human hand was constructed with common computer-aided design software, and cylindrical handles and elliptical handles were added for comparison. All of the handles were used to record the participants' grip force to evaluate the operating efficiency of the handles. Finally, the participants completed a comfort-rating questionnaire. The results show that contours based on the hand provided the highest operating performance and the best overall comfort-rating compared to cylindrical handles and elliptical cylindrical handles. The newly developed handles in the grip force tasks have the highest push performance and the best comfort ratings compared to traditional cylindrical and elliptical handles.

A collaborative effort between the Mechanical & Aerospace Engineering department and Faculty Innovations in Teaching & Learning (FITL) Center, the AGP allows for the real-time grading of assignments and provides immediate feedback to students in Mechanical Engineering courses. The platform is designed to work within the Total Quality Management (TQM) paradigm. With this system, only exemplary work is accepted. However, students are free to repeat an assignment an unlimited number of times until they produce work that meets this standard. Grade thresholds are established based on the volume of acceptable work submitted. This threshold is distributed to students at the beginning of the semester. The student can determine the grade they wish to achieve, and stop working when they have reached the desired grade threshold. Applying a Total Quality Management (TQM) Tool in an educational setting will provide a quantum leap forward in providing both flexibility and support to our students. It draws on existing educational paradigms such as constructivism and the experiential theory of learning, yet offers a new and exciting approach to covering course material. Students get increased flexibility to tailor their workflow to achieve specific course objectives while the instructor is freed from routine calculations and allowed to focus on student support. Additionally, it breaks down barriers often encountered by students working remotely and on other campuses. It is expected that TQM and AGP will fundamentally change the way that Engineering is taught for the foreseeable future. The paper will discuss the development of the Automated Grading Platform and its deployment and testing in an undergraduate Computer Aided Design (CAD) course. This course is typically taken by freshman in the Mechanical Engineering program. We will discuss the need for such an application, its development, and the results of our pilot study. Emphasis will be placed on the effect that the AGP has on student outcomes and important metrics. The role of the AGP within the broader context of student resources will also be considered.

An implementation which satisfies especially the concurrent nature of today's design processes and allow for multi-objective decision-making is multi-agent systems. Such systems consist of entities that are capable of autonomous action, interact intelligently with their environment, communicate and collaborate.

These offshore wind turbines are oftentimes installed with jack-up vessels. At the site of operation these vessels lift their hull above the water surface by extending their jacking legs. The vessel’s seaway-induced motions at the moment of initial contact between leg and seabed define the critical dynamic structural loads onto the legs and the jacking mechanism, which have to be minimised. Therefore, an analysis of the seakeeping behaviour during the sensitive jacking sequence is required in the early design stage in order to define the vessel’s operational limits of sea state. The ship design environment E4 is an open software framework, being developed by the Institute of Ship Design and Ship Safety, which provides various methods for the dynamic analysis of a digital twin of the actual ship. However, these methods are restricted to conventional ship-type structures whereas the analysis of the seakeeping behaviour during the jack-up process further requires a consideration of the jacking legs’ hydrodynamic influence. For a holistic analysis of the seakeeping behaviour, the forces onto the legs were thus accounted for by a Morison approach in the calculation of the required response amplitude operators. This paper presents the calculation of the vessel’s seakeeping behaviour in irregular waves in time domain on the basis of these modified RAOs. The applied method calculates the vessel’s response motions in six degrees of freedom. Since the roll motion tends to show the largest response amplitudes in a seaway this degree of freedom is calculated in a non-linear way with respect to the wave amplitude and the roll angle by solving its equation of motion. The motions in the residual degrees of freedom are calculated from the underlying linear response amplitude operators. The achieved results are validated by model tests of a jack-up vessel with extended legs in irregular long-crested waves. This extended method represents a quick computational tool for early design applications in order to determine limiting sea states for the jacking sequence, which is a major design aspect of such ships. © 2020 by the International Society of Offshore and Polar Engineers (ISOPE).",Jack-up vessel; Seakeeping; Ship design; Time domain,Arctic engineering; Computer programming; Degrees of freedom (mechanics); Digital twin; Equations of motion; Fossil fuels; Ocean currents; Offshore oil well production; Offshore wind farms; Seakeeping; Shipbuilding; Computational tools; Early design stages; Equation of motion; Fossil fuel energy; Operational limits; Response amplitude operator; Response amplitudes; Six degrees of freedom; Time domain analysis,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85090912393

However, assessing the technical feasibility of an automated assembly solution for a dedicated process is difficult and often determined by the geometry of the given product parts. Among others, decisive criterions of the automation feasibility are the ability to separate and isolate single parts or the capability of component self-alignment in final position. To assess the feasibility, a questionnaire based evaluation scheme has been developed and applied by Fraunhofer researchers. However, the results strongly depend on the implicit knowledge and experience of the single engineer performing the assessment.

The design class introduces students to Computer Aided Design (CAD), Computer Aided Manufacturing (CAM), design for manufacturing, three-dimensional (3D) printing. At Wayne State University, we desire to provide students with a rudimentary understanding of embedded control as part of the first-year design experience. However, time constraints imposed by the length of a semester focuses instruction on CAD, 3D printing and the engineering design process. This leaves insufficient time for an in-depth discussion of computer programming and other matters pertinent to embedded control. As such, a new initiative began in the Fall 2019 semester where embedded control systems can be incorporated into projects by students with little or no programming experience. To bridge the gap between the desire for providing an understanding of embedded control and the lack of time for in-depth instruction of pertinent skills, a set of ""Standard Embedded Control Modules""have been developed for student use. Each module consists of a common standard electrical/electronic hardware component along with relevant standard software modules, which provide the intelligence to exercise control of those hardware components. Undergraduate Teaching Assistants, along with the Instructor, help student teams in selecting the modules required for their selected project. It is then incumbent upon the student teams to design appropriate mechanical interfaces, follow electrical build instructions, and define required functionality for implementation into their projects. This initiative was introduced in a handful of projects during the Fall 2019 semester and boasts a positive impact on making projects more realistic, capturing student interest, and generating enthusiasm among students. This paper will provide an overview of our approach, lessons learned, and future endeavors.  © American Society for Engineering Education, 2020.",,3D printers; Computer aided design; Computer aided manufacturing; Computer control; Computer control systems; Computer programming; Embedded systems; Engineering education; Design for Manufacturing; Embedded computers; Embedded control; First-year engineering designs; Hardware components; Manufacturing design; Programming experience; Student teams; Three-dimensional (3D) printing; Wayne State University; Students,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85125207298

Especially technologies that are focusing on Mixed or Virtual Reality environments are getting very popular in the field of assembly validation, because of a huge potential to reduce the necessary number of physical prototypes. Therefore costs and time within product integration phase can be saved. These technologies can provide a high level of immersion for pick-and place or assembly tasks and allow a scale 1:1 interaction with the future product or production system. Still plenty of limitations for a complete substitution of physical prototypes exist due to the lack of physical and haptic behavior of these virtual prototypes. Within this paper, a development method and applications for haptic interaction with force-feedback devices for assembly validation is presented. Focusing especially on the development process of a mixed prototype with virtual and physical elements, so called hybrid prototypes, a hard- and software framework is presented. Nowadays virtual assembly methods for Virtual Reality and computer haptics are still based on a high level of expertise in providing technology and testbeds. To keep a high level of flexibility regarding virtual validation models, easily applicable procedures for modelling, im-/exporting and configuration of the prototype are needed for a virtual assembly use case. In this paper, a new and connected processing pipeline is presented that describes and guides a non-expert user from CAD environment to the implementation and configuration of prototypes for haptic interaction. © 2017 The Authors.

Voice technology is a growing field and is becoming more prominent in our day-to-day lives. National Public Research, in a study conducted in early 2020, found that an estimated 60 million people (24% of total U.S. adult population) own a voice-enabled smart speaker [1]. The number of smart speakers in the U.S. household has grown by an astounding 135% in last two years [1]. Voice incorporated devices serve people of different age groups, disabilities and even professions. The latest versions can also function within limits based on the preferences, choices and past behavior of its users [2]. Smart speakers and voice assistants are increasingly becoming a part of our daily lives. The Amazon Alexa devices are one such cloud-based, continuously improving, digital assistants designed to respond to voice commands. One of the newer innovative applications of the Amazon Alexa devices is its integration into higher education. However, most of this integration has been through campus life and residence halls or higher-level programming courses [3] [4]. This paper summarizes our efforts on embedding voice technology into a first-year engineering design (FED101) course in the Newark College of Engineering (NCE) at New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT) that reviews the basic concepts of engineering and introduces some tools used for the design and implementation of devices and systems. The goal is to enhance student learning through hands-on projects in first-year design courses and use this to not only further engage students with the course content, but also foster the skills necessary for effective communication on projects with multiple stakeholders. Students, with very little background on the subject, are able to design a working device such as a portable fan, a remotely controlled car, or a robotic arm. Students are using Computer-Aided Design (CAD) software, making the parts with 3D printers, creating an Arduino code to control the action of their device, and finally writing a voice interface (given a skeleton code) to actuate the servo motors on the device using voice commands. For example, students use voice to turn a fan on or off, change its speed, and enable oscillation. Ours is a unique approach towards not only integrating new emerging technology into the classroom but also finding new ways to engage students and help them learn new skills. Upon completion of this pilot, students are expected to have expanded their technical knowledge as well as soft skills such as communication, collaboration, and listening skills. They will have learned how to personalize Voice technology, and the researchers would have improved the course design as well as prepared for the study to be offered on a larger scale. © American Society for Engineering Education 2020.",,3D printers; Computer aided design; Curricula; Digital devices; Engineering education; Integration; Design and implementations; Devices and systems; Effective communication; Emerging technologies; First-year engineering; First-year engineering designs; Multiple stakeholders; Programming course; Students,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85095755559

To minimise the impact on our environment and natural resources, car manufacturers are opting for a smart, green and integrated transport system that requires highly efficient and compact drivetrain solutions. This is a complex task for motor designers in view of the multiple objectives and constraints that involve both mechanical, thermal and electromagnetics effects. Powerful multidisciplinary design procedures are therefore necessary to get accurate and comprehensive results in a computationally efficient way. This paper aims to present the optimisation of a high speed copper rotor induction motor for a traction application using Motor-CAD and optiSLang software. The main goal of the research is to design a rare-earth free magnet motor for the next generation electric powertrains, while ensuring the industrial feasibility for mass production at low manufacturing costs and providing higher performance than current technologies. The selected approach combines cutting edge sensitivity analysis, metamodeling and optimisation techniques in order to provide an optimum design with respect to given specification. The motor is optimised first electromagnetically, then thermally, while the mechanical behaviour from a rotor stress point of view is evaluated at the end of the process. © 2020 IET Conference Proceedings.

The ongoing research work is being undertaken with a view to modernize well-known technical solutions and develop new scientific principles for gas compression with the use of labyrinth compressors. From the published materials, it became known that when designing labyrinth pumps, the screw auger on the pump rotor can be replaced with a set of vane wheels. This design approach should be transferred from the field of pumping technology to the field of compressor technology as well. At the initial stage of such research microlevel models of new turbocompressors have been developed to test their performance. Further, was made the transition from the low-cost physical experiments with micro-level models to a deeper study of the working process for the basic model of the compressor with the screw rotor. 3D-model development was carried out with the use of the SolidWorks 3D CAD-system. In order to undertake a calculation study, the FloEFD software package of computational fluid dynamics developed by Mentor Graphics Corporation has been used. The results of the research findings can be used for the development of energy-efficient technologies for the compression and pumping of various gases. The development of cheaper and more economical pump-compressor units will allow for the solution of urgent hydrocarbon exploration and production problems in abnormal operating conditions. Based on similar compressor units, there is a possibility to develop other sectors of science and technology as well. © 2020 Institut za Istrazivanja.

Many implementations of communication protocols, including those in vehicular networks, occur within regulated environments where agile development methods are traditionally discouraged. We propose a framework and metrics to measure adherence to security, quality and software effectiveness regulations if developers desire the cost and schedule benefits of agile methods. After providing an overview of specific challenges that a regulated environment imposes on communications software development, we proceed to examine the 12 agile principles and how they relate to a regulatory environment. From this review we identify two metrics to measure performance of three key regulatory attributes of software for communications applications, and then recommend an approach of either tools, agile methods or DevOps that is best positioned to satisfy its regulated environment attributes. By considering the recommendations in this paper, managers of software-dominant communications programs in a regulated environment can gain insight into leveraging the benefits of agile methods. © 2020 IEEE.",Communication system security; Data privacy; Design tools and techniques; Iterative methods; Real-time and embedded systems,Application programs; Software quality; Agile development methods; Agile software development; Communications applications; Communications software; Privacy requirements; Regulatory environment; Security and privacy; Vehicular networks; Software design,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85083451767

The procedure allows designing SSs with good prediction accuracy and a low number of inputs. The design of an SS for a real-world industrial process is used.

The AUTOSAR methodology has two main activities: System configuration and the Electronic Control Unit (ECU) configuration. The system configuration is the mapping of the software components to the ECUs based on the system requirements. The ECU configuration process is an important part of the ECU software integration and generation. ECU specific information is extracted from the system configuration description and all the necessary information for the implementation such as tasks, scheduling, assignments of the runnables to tasks and configuration of the Basic Software (BSW) modules, are performed. The ECU configuration process involves configuring every single module of the AUTOSAR architecture. Due to the high complexity and redundancy of this process, it has to be supported by different tool-related editors that can automatically generate source files like c and h for the configuration. In this paper, we propose a method to automate the ECU configuration process for AUTOSAR. We use Module Configuration Templates (MCT) written in Xtend programming language along with a Basic software configuration source code generator (BSG) Computer-Aided Design (CAD) tool developed at APAG Elektronik. This tool can extract the configuration parameters and automatically generate the required ECU module configuration. The Watchdog module will be used as an example to generate and integrate the ECU configuration. This enables the seamless generation of the software configurations from the system level requirements to the software implementation and therefore ensures consistency, correctness, cost efficiency and reduces the work done by the developer to generate the configuration. © 2020 SAE International.

The SDE, or Stylistic Design Engineering, is a structured engineering method for carrying out automotive design projects. The SDE method consists of six different phases: (1) Analysis of stylistic trends; (2) Sketches; (3) 2D Computer Aided Design (CAD) drawings; (4) 3D CAD models; (5) Rendering; (6) Solid stylistic model (also called style maquette). This project deals with the external redesign of the Fiat 600 multiple, a small minivan which was very successful in the 1950s and 1960s. SDE is a methodology consisting of various technologies and design methodologies that will be further explained in detail, such as the Pininfarina method, the Quality Function Deployment (QFD) method, Benchmarking (BM), and Top Flop Analysis (TPA). The work was organized according to the different phases. Initially, the Fiat style was studied, in particular the style of the FIAT 600 MULTI PURPOUSE VEHICLE (MPV). This step is essential to better understand the characteristics of the brand and also the main characteristics carried out over the decades. Then we moved on to the freehand sketching phase, based on what we learned in the previous phase of the study. When a satisfactory shape was found for the new car, by analyzing and discarding the different proposals of the various types of style, we proceeded to the evaluation of the proportions and dimensions through two-dimensional drawings and finally we obtained the three-dimensional shape of the new car thanks to 3D CAD software and rendering software. Many advantages in the industrial world SDE takes together with its development. In fact, until the early 2000s, car design and styling was considered quite a craft activity, not a technical or scientific one, mostly based on the great capability of famous car designers and masters, just like Giugiaro, Zagato, Bertone, Pininfarina, Stephenson, Bangle, etc. Then, thanks to the industrial activity of Eng. Lorenzo Ramacciotti, former CEO of Pininfarina Spa and Mechanical Engineer, and also thanks to the academic studies developed at ALMA MATER STUDIORUM University of Bologna, SDE became the object of attention, because it is able to systematize the car design process and reduce costs. With SDE, a good design research or an industrial product development team can complete a car design project, also without the presence of a mentor. Car Design Process finally becomes with SDE a scientific method; Car Design becomes with SDE an industrial method. Industrial needs are nice products made in a short time; SDE is structured to attend these issues. Industrial challenges follow innovation, in shape and functionality; SDE is able to recognize innovation. Industrial benefits can be reached with SDE, ensuring beautiful aesthetic projects are realized systematically and with low costs. © 2020 by the authors.

Codes of new generation are intended for the safety assessment of NPP with FR (BREST-OD-300 or BN-1200) with closed nuclear fuel cycle. Under ""codes of new generation"" is understood commercializable software product with the following characteristics: based on the state-of-the-art level of the theoretical models and experimental data; founded on the efficient numerical algorithms; written according to the up to date requirements of the programing languages standards and adjusted to the up to date computing technics; provided with the graphical user interface; documented: users' guide, reference manual, programmers guide; automatically connected with the CAD systems. There is one more requirement to the developed codes of new generation, that is obligate according to the Russian federal rules and regulations to use them for NPP safety assessment: codes should be certified by Rostechnadzor. The first priority was to develop the codes that did not have the Russian analogues but that are required for safety assessment. Starting from 2010 the high-level team was formed including the specialists from scientific institutes, organizations of the State Atomic Energy Corporation ROSATOM, institutions of high education, combining specialist from different areas. This allows achieving the following key results to the mid of 2018: 26 codes have been developed with the different level of detalization and complexity, including integral multi-physical codes (neutronics MCU-FR, ODETTA, CORNER, NDP-ACE, BPSD, COMPLEX; thermohydraulic HYDRA-IBRAE/LM, LOGOS, CONV-3D, KUPOL-BR; fuel rod behavior code BERKUT; codes for analysis of fission products transport in the environment, including safety validation of the disposal of all types of prepared radioactive wastes, ROM, ROUZ, Sibylla, GeRa; codes for modeling processes of the closed nuclear fuel cycle KOD TP and VIZART; code for probabilistic safety analysis CRISS 5.3; integral codes for NPP safety justification SOCRAT-BN and EUCLID), 6 of them are certified in Rostechnadzor; the codes of new generation are distributed by the User License Agreements; the First Codes of New Generation User School was conducted for the young specialists of atomic and other industries; the codes of new generation are used for NPP with BREST-OD-300 and BN-1200 reactors safety assessment. At the next stage it is assumed to develop the codes of new generation that does not have the foreign analogues (in particular, codes for closed nuclear cycle objects safety assessment), to improve the certain models, to create the positive public image of the developed software products by taking part in the international benchmarks and conferences, to expand the codes field of application by validation of the codes on the unique novel experiments. © 2020 IOP Publishing Ltd.

Rapidly decreasing DNA synthesis service prices and the concomitant increase of research and development scales bolstered by computer-aided DNA design tools and laboratory automation has driven up the demand for synthetic DNA. While vendors provide user-friendly online portals for purchasing synthetic DNA, customers still face the time-consuming task of checking each vendor of choice for their ability and pricing to synthesize the desired sequences. As a result, ordering large batches of DNA sequences can be a laborious manual procedure in an otherwise increasingly automatable workflow.

Unlike the proteomics community, practitioners of SMS lack adequate computational tools. Here, we review new developments in the Mass Spec Studio: an expandable ecosystem of workflows for the analysis of complementary SMS techniques with linkages to modeling. Current functionality in the Studio (version 2) supports three major SMS workflows (crosslinking, hydrogen/deuterium exchange and covalent labelling) and two pipelines for structural modeling, with a special focus on data integration. The Mass Spec Studio is an architecture focused on rapid and robust extension of functionality by a community of developers. Significance: This review surveys the new data analysis capabilities within the Mass Spec Studio, a rich framework for rapid software development specifically targeting the community of structural proteomics and structural mass spectrometry. Updates to crosslinking, hydrogen/deuterium-exchange and covalent labeling apps are provided as well as a utility for translating such analyses into restraints that support integrative structural modeling. These new capabilities, together with the underlying design tools and content, provide the community with a wealth of resources to tackle complex structural problem and design new approaches to data analysis. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Covalent labeling; Crosslinking; Hydrogen/deuterium exchange; Integrative modeling; Structural mass spectrometry,Ecosystem; Mass Spectrometry; Proteins; Proteomics; Software; protein; article; covalent bond; cross linking; data analysis; data integration; deuterium hydrogen exchange; ecosystem; human; language; mass spectrometry; physician; pipeline; software; structural proteomics; workflow; ecosystem; mass spectrometry; proteomics,Article,Final,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85086008817

Consequently, there are growing demands for more flexible, accurate, and efficient 3D EM simulation, easy accessible to many engineers, many of them lacking deep knowledge of applied electromagnetics. To meet such needs it is necessary to adjust existing tools to create friendly 3D simulation environment, not only for development and testing of IoT, but even for inclusion of these tools into functioning of IoT. In this paper we propose the concept/structure of such environment. For the base of such environment we propose WIPL-D commercial general-purpose 3D EM solver WIPL-D Pro and its CAD variant-WIPL-D Pro CAD. In addition we added libraries of EM models of a) electrical components (e.g. antennas), b) environmental elements (e.g. moving platforms, indoor/outdoor objects, human phantoms), and c) templates that combines electrical components and environmental elements into IoT scenarios. Special tools/procedures are included/developed to enable easy creation of new libraries' components and their composition into complex scenarios, as well as for effective processing of EM field data obtained by simulation.

To this end, the paper discusses cross-disciplinary concepts related to the development of the robotic cell and the associated command and control system such as the Computer-Aided Design (CAD) interface, the slicing software and the path planning for the robot manipulator toward printing the selected workpiece. This study also reports the development of a virtual production cell that simulates the AM toolpath generated for the desired workpiece, the adaptation of the simulation environments to enable AM and the development of a user application to setup, command and control the AM processes. If a digital twin setup is efficiently built, with a good correlation between the simulation environment and the real systems, developers may explore this functionality to significantly reduce the development cycle, which can be very long in AM applications where metallurgic properties, part distortion and other properties need to be monitored and controlled. Design/methodology/approach: To generate the robot manipulator path, several simulation programs were considered, resulting in different solutions to program and control the robot of choice [in this study, Kuka and Asea Brown Boveri (ABB) robots were considered]. By integrating the solutions from Slic3r, Inventor, Kuka.Sim, Kuka.Officelite, RobotStudio and Visual Studio software packages, this study aims to develop a functional simulation system capable of producing a given workpiece. For this purpose, a graphical user interface (GUI) was designed to provide the user with a higher level of control over the entire process toward simplifying the programming and implementation events. Findings: The presented solutions are compatible with the simulation environments of specific robot manufacturers, namely, ABB and Kuka, meaning that the authors aim to align the developments with most of the currently realized AM processing cells. In the long-term, the authors aim to build an AM system that implements a produce-from-CAD strategy i.e. that can be commanded directly from the CAD package used to design the part the authors are interested in. Research limitations/implications: This study attempts to shed light on the industrial AM, a field that is being constantly evolved. Arguably, one of the most important aspects of an AM system is path planning for the AM operation, which must be independent of the robotic system used. This study depicts a generic implementation that can be used with several robot control systems. The paper demonstrates the principle with ABB and Kuka robots, exploiting in detail simulation environments that can be used to create digital twins of the real AM systems. This is very important in actual industrial setups, as a good correlation between the digital twins (simulation environment and real system) will enable developers to explore the AM system in not only a more efficient manner, greatly reducing the development cycle but also as a way to fully develop new solutions without stopping the real setup. In this research, a systematic review of robot systems through simulation environments was presented, aiming to emulate the logic that is, used in the production cell development, disregarding the system brand. The adopted digital twin strategy enables the authors to fully simulate, both operationally and functionality, the real AM system. For this purpose, different solutions were explored using robots from two different manufacturers and related simulation environments, illustrating a generic solution that is not bound to a certain brand. Practical implications: Using specific programming tools, fully functional virtual production cells were conceived that can receive the instructions for the movements of the robot, using a transmission control protocol/internet protocol. Conversion of the CAD information into the robot path instructions for the robot was the main research question in this study. With the different simulation systems, a program that translates the CAD data into an acceptable format brings the robot closer to the automatic path planning based on CAD data. Both ABB and Kuka systems can access the CAD data, converting it to the correct robot instructions that are executed. Eventually, a functional and intuitive GUI application capable of commanding the simulation for the execution of the AM was implemented. The user can set the desired object and run a completely automatic AM process through the designated GUI. Comparing ABB simulation with the Kuka system, an important distinction can be found, namely, in the exportation of the programs. As the Kuka program runs with add-ons, the solution will not be exported while maintaining its functionality, whereas the ABB program can be integrated with a real controller because it is completely integrated with modules of the virtual controller. Originality/value: To conclude, with the solutions exploited, this study reports a step forward into the development of a fully functional generic AM cell. The final objective is to implement an AM system that is, independent of any robot manufacturer brand and uses a produce-from-CAD strategy (c.f. digital manufacturing). In other words, the authors presented a system that is fully automatic, can be explored from a CAD package and, consequently, can be used by any CAD designer, without specific knowledge of robotics, materials and AM systems. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",ABB; Additive manufacturing (AM); C#; CAD/Computer-Aided Manufacturing; Industry 4.0; KUKA; Process simulation; Python; Robotics; Slic3r; TCP/IP,3D printers; Additives; Agricultural robots; Cells; Command and control systems; Computer aided design; Computer aided software engineering; Computer software; Controllers; Cytology; Digital twin; Flexible manipulators; Functional programming; Graphical user interfaces; Industrial research; Industrial robots; Machine design; Marking machines; Modular robots; Process control; Robot applications; Robot programming; Robotics; Design/methodology/approach; Functional simulations; Generic implementation; Graphical user interfaces (GUI); Metallurgic properties; Robot control systems; Simulation environment; Transmission control protocol/internet protocols; Visual servoing,Article,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85084195026

Based on the experience in the development of innovative methodologies to cope with complex and highly integrated aircraft, ASTRID-H has been developed to guide students, researchers and engineers through the very first phases of the design of high-speed vehicles. ASTRID-H supports the users to move from the statistical evaluation of the guess data and the identification of the design space to the geometrical characterization of the vehicle guaranteeing a proper integration of the main subsystems. Already available and widely used mathematical models are here integrated in a new algorithm to face the complexity of the design of high-speed vehicles. In addition, the coefficients of the semi-empirical models that were not focusing on high-speed vehicles have been updated to widen classical theories to cover high-speed vehicles. The resulting implemented methodology allows the users to cope with complex multidisciplinary problems, which encompass a variety of interrelated disciplines and heterogeneous levels of fidelity. Furthermore, this paper reports the some of the main results achieved during the validation of the methodology thanks to the application to the STRATOFLY MR3 vehicle case study.

The manifold benefits of these molds include: (1) the integration of structural elements such as periodic lattices in order to optimize weight versus strength; (2) the structural inclusion of unique features such as embossed part numbers and/or other details of the production history; and (3) complex geometries that generate new casting applications not possible previously. Additive Manufacturing is often described as providing “complexity for free”, which may not be entirely precise but generally holds true and the identification of castings that are sufficiently complex to benefit from 3D printing is generally left to the intuition of the designer or foundry. New software tools are necessary for foundries to discover opportunities in which the additional costs of 3D printing are compensated by the benefits of increased structural complexity. This paper describes a complexity evaluation tool that scores CAD models to determine the most economical casting approach based on slicing and 2D geometry evaluation.

The motivation of the research and development task was to implement a module in an existing CAD system which can calculate the center of gravity, which requires investigating the distribution of the mass. There were complex CAD models designed in the application called Siemens NX. It has some built-in functions for designers for supporting the calculations. The first chapter of the paper overviews the mathematical background of the calculation. For software development point of view, the authors investigated the programming facilities of Siemens NX. Investigations showed that the first task is to assign material properties for the components that are in the design. Our goal was to automate this task as the manual material attribute assignment is time-consuming and potentially leads to errors. To perform this task, the relevant documentation and literature have been reviewed. A recently published model carries out material assignments by identifying the relationship between shape, functionality, and material in parts. There is a study that analyses the basic concepts and relationships affecting all aspects of material selection. In this paper, a new software component is presented, providing an approach for material assignment. The center of gravity calculation based on the valid material data then provides a reliable result.

Sufficiently accurate stress distribution, maximum warp angle and displacement (Z component) of above mentioned parts have been obtained through the whole tensile process. The simulation process has been carried out based on reaction forces and compared with experimentally obtained results. Material characteristics, load and constraint information, surface boundary conditions, nonlinear material models and load curve information are also covered by Mechanical Event Simulation (MES) Module of Algor software.

To meet this demand, a new generation of aircrafts has been developed, with more complex landing gear configurations and higher total gross weight. Therefore, new challenges were created for the design of airport pavements. In this sense, software tools were created to meet this need. So the focus of this paper is to understand how this computational capacity has been applied in the design of airport pavements. To do this, this writing addresses the evolution of design methods, their formulations, how these methods are applied, and finally, what is the state-of-the-art for the software tools for airport pavement design. For the development of this text, the software FAARFIELD (USA), Alize-Airfield (France), APSDS (Australia), and PCASE (USA) were evaluated. Finally, it was concluded that the main airport pavement design software has similar formulations and methodologies. In general, these applications apply layered elastic methods, with little variations and adaptations to the different existing normative standards. Also, some applications apply finite element methods to their design steps. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.",Airport; Engineering software applications; Pavement design,Airport runways; Computer software; Information systems; Information use; Landing gear (aircraft); Pavement overlays; Airport pavement; Australia; Computational capacity; Design method; Design steps; Gear configurations; Gross weight; State of the art; Design,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85086268194

One way to reduce the production cost is by degrading the quality of the product, which is “worst-case” scenario and it should not be used. Another way is to turn to the application of new knowledge and insights, which enables better utilization of resources and processes. New knowledge may include new materials and/or new technologies, but may also include new ways and methods of product development and design. The increasing complexity of products, the use of new materials, methodologies and technologies, require increasing computer support for the design process. Because of this, there is a need for a better scientific approach and a better understanding of the design process using a number of software design tools, interaction between these tools and better collaboration between designers. This paper describes the process of developing the knowledge based intelligent integrated computer aided design (IICAD) system for the calculation, dimensioning and development of a bridge crane model with two main supports. This methodology of IICAD software development can be used to develop numerous other IICAD computer systems for various fields of engineering. Main contribution of this paper is above mentioned and presented methodology. Also, goal of this paper is to prove that standard computer aided design (CAD) systems, needs to be expanded with this knowledge based intelligent integrated systems to achieve higher levels of performance. © 2020 Journal of Applied Science and Engineering.

One of the proposed solutions to these situations is the computational modelling of anatomical structures. The present study shows a methodology for obtaining high-biofidelity biomodels, where a novel imagenological technique is used, which applies several CAM/CAD computer programs that allow a better precision for obtaining a biomodel, with highly accurate morphological specifications of the molar and tissues that shape the biomodel. The biomodel developed is the first lower molar subjected to a basic chewing simulation through the application of the finite element method, resulting in a viable model, able to be subjected to various simulations to analyse molar biomechanical characteristics, as well as pathological conditions to evaluate restorative materials and develop treatment plans. When research is focused in medical and dental investigation aspects, numerical analyses could allow the implementation of several tools commonly used by mechanical engineers to provide new answers to old problems in these areas. With this methodology, it is possible to perform high-fidelity models no matter the size of the anatomical structure, nor the complexity of its structure and internal tissues.

To reduce the development and testing cost of electronics, reliability analysis needs to be incorporated into the design stage. Compared with traditional approaches, the physics of failure (PoF) methodology can better address cost reduction in the design stage. However, there are many difficulties in practical engineering applications, such as processing large amounts of engineering information simultaneously. Therefore, a flexible approach and a software system for assisting designers in developing a reliability analysis based on the PoF method in electronic product design processing are proposed. This approach integrates the PoF method and computer-aided simulation methods, such as CAD, FEM and CFD.The software system integrates functional modules such as product modeling, load-stress analysis and reliability analysis, which can help designers analyze the reliability of electronic products in actual engineering design. This system includes software and hardware that validate the simulation models. Finally, a case study is proposed in which the software system is used to analyze the filter module reliability of an industrial communication system. The results of the analysis indicate that the system can effectively promote reliability and can ensure the accuracy of analysis with high computing efficiency. © 2020, Polish Academy of Sciences Branch Lublin.

The diffusion of 3D printing technologies promoted their introduction in the medical field, giving rise to several applications, such as the development of 3D-printed anatomical imaging phantoms. These devices provide controlled experimental environments for the improvement of medical imaging techniques, as they mimic the morphological and physiological features of different body parts. However, to obtain a 3D printable model from medical imaging data, different post-processing steps are needed, which require a considerable effort. Supports generation is often a critical task, as it requires to find the minimum amount of support structures necessary to hold a part in place during the printing process. This is particularly difficult for complex anthropomorphic models, for which a high printing level of detail, along with a reasonable number of internal supports, is usually needed. In this paper, an automatic method for the design of efficient support structures is proposed, which is suitable for 3D printing of complex anatomical phantoms, even with non-professional FDM 3D printers. A custom design software was developed, which places paraboloid-shaped shells to support all and only the critical points of the 3D model. This provided different advantages over support generation by means of common slicing software, allowing a reduction of material waste and printing times, along with an easier and faster dissolution of soluble supports for the clean-up of phantoms empty volumes. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",3D printing; Anatomical phantoms; FDM; Medical imaging; Supports design,3D modeling; Biochemical engineering; Design; Frequency division multiplexing; Ground supports; Image enhancement; Image segmentation; Medical computing; Medical imaging; Phantoms; Printing presses; 3-D printing; Anthropomorphic models; Automatic extraction; Experimental environment; Internal supports; Physiological features; Segmentation techniques; Support structures; 3D printers,Conference paper,Final,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85075893560

Development of digital imaging, designing and manufacturing techniques have led to the possibility of manufacturing prosthetic restorations without the need for conventional laboratory procedures. One of the methods of production is the technology of laser sintering of metal powders – Direct Metal Laser Sintering (DMLS). With the use of CAD/CAM systems, it can replace the traditional technique of casting the crown substructure with the lost wax technique. Aim of study. To compare the compatibility of the digital design of prosthetic crowns with restorations made with the use of laser sintering technology (DMLS). Materials and methods. The study material consisted of five prosthetic crowns made in DMLS technology based on the intraoral scan. Internal surfaces of the restorations were scanned using a laboratory scanner. The obtained point clouds in the form of a mesh of internal surfaces and crown designs in the form of CAD models were sent to the GOM Inspect 2018 software. Design matching (CAD models) with scans of their internal surface was made for each crown. In this way, a heat map was obtained, illustrating the deviations between the compared models and meshes. Results. The first and the fifth crowns were characterized by an average deviation of 0.00 ± 0.03 mm and 0.00 ± 0.05 mm, respectively. The highest mean deviation was obtained when the second crown was measured, i.e. 0.03 ± 0.02 mm. The highest maximum positive deviation was recorded for the fourth crown, whose value was 0.12 mm, while the largest negative deviation was observed in the first and the fifth crowns – this value was-0.10 mm. Conclusion. Analysis of the compatibility of digital designs with ready-made crowns showed that laser sinter technology enables the fabrication of crowns with accuracy corresponding to the presented results. Failure to obtain a statistical constant value of the deviation makes it impossible to determine the error occurring at the stage of manufacturing of the prosthetic restoration in DMLS technology. The application of the described method allows virtual control of the degree of fit of the prosthetic restoration before placing it in the patient’s mouth. © Zarząd Główny PTS 2020.",Accuracy; Crown preparation; Digital dentistry,,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85086261360

The objective is to extract intermediate sketch planes that well represent the input scan and are close enough to the original design intent. These sketches can then be easily converted into CAD models automatically due to their faithful representation of the input geometry. One objective is to avoid incorporating user/company dependent content in the CAD reconstruction process. The intermediate representation shall be directly supported in any CAD environment to boost the designer's work without the need of supplementary (model conversion, automatic feature recognition) steps. Nowadays, it is common to digitize an object and reconstruct its geometric primitives. However, this reconstruction contains only geometry. In literature, the final goal might be met by recovering the modeling tree itself, by means of automatic feature recognition, and converting to the proper format of a specific CAD software package. However, the constructed tree and its conversion introduce issues in the reconstruction process. The definition of an exact modeling tree, and the production of a meaningful final CAD model are rather hard to obtain. This imposes a rather inefficient working method, thereby heavily impacting the designer's modeling skills. Copyright © 2020 by SCITEPRESS - Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

Modularization is one of the more applied design methods for ETO systems; however, it is necessary to integrate traditional tools with practices of design optimization to improve the development of a proposal. Even if commercial design tools for modeling specific types of engineering systems are available, the application of design optimization is still based on the use of tools not integrated with each level of the design phases. Moreover, these tools often require software customization. The integration of geometrical modeling, simulations, analysis, and optimization concerns the interaction between different tools. This paper describes an approach to support the Multi-Object Optimization related to the design of complex ETO systems with a focus on the oil & gas context. In this context, Genetic Algorithms and Constraint Satisfaction Problems are introduced as tools to support the design optimization of steel structures.

Flexibility helps to reduce lead time, weight, cost, and product development time. Scanning technologies are in tandem with support software that helps a designer to (re)design products at a cheaper and faster rate. There is a need to understand different types of flexibilities and associated application of 3D scanner. In this article, we have conducted an extensive review of the available literature for identifying various flexibilities of 3D scanners and its applications. This research categorises 3D scanner flexibility and applications into five major types. From design to final quality inspection, these flexibilities play a significant role in industries and sectors to achieve optimum performance. Ranking of these flexibilities and their impact on different applications are accomplished using the analytical hierarchical process (AHP) with the help of expert opinion. The ranking of five significant flexibilities by using 3D scanners, undertaken through the AHP technique shows that scanning provides object flexibility at a higher level. The impacts of different flexibilities on applications are also weighted, and it shows that all flexibilities are enough to achieve application individually. This digital technology is helpful to create the customised product which is also helpful to achieve goals of Industry 4.0. It facilitates the customisation and has a significant impact on the design applications. This study provides an understanding of the 3D scanner in the context of flexibilities by identifying the different flexibilities it offers when used for different applications. Findings may assist developing a decision support system for the selection of 3D scanners for the different applications. Copyright © 2020, IGI Global.

In the case of single productions or small quantities, this possibility is not taken into account. In the case of serial productions, on the other hand, the optimization of the design time is of paramount importance due to the large amount of money that can be saved. To address these challenges, this investigation proposes a topological optimization procedure for mechanical parts that have complex geometric shapes using the integration of CAD, MBD, and FEA software. The theory of linear elastodynamics is the basic approach used for the integration process carried out in this paper. In particular, the components analyzed in this work belong to the closing system of the ATR 42/72 cargo door. To explain the software integration procedure devised in the paper using SOLIDWORKS, MSC ADAMS, and ANSYS, a slider-crank mechanism is employed first as a demonstrative example. Subsequently, this computational procedure is applied to a flexible component of the latching system of the door whose loading conditions were previously obtained considering the entire opening mechanism modeled as a rigid multibody system. Finally, the topological optimization of the mechanical part is carried out and a consequential reduction in the amount of material to use is performed. The results obtained are considered significant since they led to considerable advantages in the door opening and closing system as well as a reduction of the total weight of the entire airplane. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.",Aircraft components; ATR 42/72 cargo door; Computer-Aided Design (CAD); Finite Element Analysis (FEA); Integration of Computer-Aided Design and Analysis (I-CAD-A); Multi-Body Dynamics (MBD); Topology optimization,Aircraft; Computation theory; Computer aided design; Computer aided engineering; Computer software; Finite element method; Integration; Topology; Aircraft components; ATR 42/72 cargo door; Computer-aided analysis; Computer-aided design; Design and analysis; Finite element analyse; Integration of computer-aided design and analyse; Multi-body dynamic; Multibody dynamic (MBD); Topology optimisation; Computer aided analysis,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,2-s2.0-85086263030

The main tests to be conducted for the homologation of the vehicle tank is the burst pressure, which is a quasi-static test. This method aims to reduce the finite element model development time by the integration between the computational software MATLAB and the FEA tool Abaqus. Since the dome shape has fundamental influence on the mechanical performances of the composite pressure vessel, the presented procedure allows the designer to quickly import the suitable dome geometry into Abaqus, without the need of going through CAD software. The first step of the method here reported is the definition of all the geometric and operational parameters necessary to the construction of the dome meridian profile. The second step is to enter those parameters in a MATLAB script, which is able to integrate the dome profile differential equation, to generate the whole tank profile and to import this profile into Abaqus. Once the geometry has been imported, a FE model of the high-pressure vessel can be built and virtual simulations can be performed. This approach could be implemented in a dome optimization process to find which dome meridian profile gives the best tank performances. © 2020 CAD Solutions, LLC,.",Composite Vessels; Filament Winding; Virtual Prototyping,ABAQUS; Bridge decks; Design; Differential equations; Domes; Geometry; MATLAB; Pressure vessels; Tanks (containers); Virtual prototyping; Composite pressure vessels; Composite vessels; Computational software; Design of composites; High-pressure vessel; Mechanical performance; Methodological approach; Operational parameters; Filament winding,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-85081079680
